Cobo Custodial Wallet is built upon bank-grade security technologies such as
Hardware Security Modules (HSM) and Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), that
is battle tested in traditional financial industry. In comparison with [Cobo MPC
Wallet](mpc-wallet/mpc-introduction) and [Smart Contract Wallet](smart-contract-wallet/cobosafe),
Cobo Custodial Wallet's clients entrust their private keys to Cobo, which are
stored in HSM and SGX based secure devices, and access their custodized assets
via web interface, mobile apps or SaaS APIs.

Cobo Custodial Wallet is more tailored to insitutions from traditional finance
industry or enterprises who don't want to store and manage private keys by
themseves. It offers a wide range of features, such as all-in-one solutoin to
manage crypto assets across multiple blockchains and
[Wallet-as-a-Service](waas-introduction) API access etc.

solution delivers the highest level of security, advanced risk management,
and developer-friendly integration options.

architecture, with a majority of funds (95%) stored in cold wallets. These
wallets are fortified by offline key shards distributed across global

are protected by bank-grade HSM, SGX, risk policies, and [Cobo
