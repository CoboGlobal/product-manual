### Configure governance policies and user roles
<Note>If you're in the testing phase and want to quickly verify deposits and withdrawals first, you can skip this section for now and configure them later.</Note>

<Accordion title="Set up governance policies and user roles">
Configuring governance policies and user roles is essential for managing access control and security in your organization. 

- [Governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-intro) define approval rules for key operations (such as member deletion, organization freezing, and API key management), using mechanisms such as auto-approval, auto-rejection, and approval quorum. You can [edit governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-edit) if the default ones don't align with your organizational needs. 

  For example, you can configure a policy to require approvals from at least two members with either Admin or Manager role before executing a member deletion, as illustrated in the screenshot below.

- [User roles](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) enable you to assign specific permissions to designated members within your organization. When you [assign a role to a member](/en/portal/organization/assign-roles-to-members), they can only perform actions allowed by that role. For instance, a member with the Viewer role can see wallet information but cannot withdraw tokens. 

  Cobo offers preset user roles. You can also [create custom roles](/en/portal/organization/create-customized-roles) tailored to your specific requirements.
