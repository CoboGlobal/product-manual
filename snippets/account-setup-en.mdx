   3. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Cobo Guard on your iOS device and link your account with your Cobo Guard.

### Configure governance policies and user roles
<Note>If you're in the testing phase and want to quickly verify deposits and withdrawals first, you can skip this section for now and configure them later.</Note>

<Accordion title="Set up governance policies and user roles">
Configuring governance policies and user roles is essential for managing access control and security in your organization. 

- [Governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-intro) define approval rules for key operations (such as member deletion, organization freezing, and API key management), using mechanisms such as auto-approval, auto-rejection, and approval quorum. You can [edit governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-edit) if the default ones don't align with your organizational needs. 

- [User roles](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) enable you to assign specific permissions to designated members within your organization. When you [assign a role to a member](/en/portal/organization/assign-roles-to-members), they can only perform actions allowed by that role. For instance, a member with the Viewer role can see wallet information but cannot withdraw tokens.

As an example, you could set up a governance policy requiring approval from at least two members with either Admin or Manager roles before deleting a member, as illustrated in the screenshot below.

### Invite members
   1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
      * For testing purposes, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
      * For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
   2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and then click **Organization**.

   4. Enter the member's email address and name, and then select appropriate [user roles](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions).
   <Note>Confirm on Cobo Guard that this invitation was initiated by you. Also, as a default governance policy, at least half of your organization admins must approve the invitation request on Cobo Guard.</Note>

   Upon receiving the invitation, new members should create their own accounts and set up Cobo Guard as described in the previous sections.

### Add chains

      * For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
   2. Click the profile icon at the bottom left, and then click **Pricing Plans**.
   3. Navigate to **Supported Chains** and click the **Chain Management** icon.
   <img src="/en/images/get-started/add-chain.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Add Chains"/>
   4. On the **Chain Management** page, review the list of available chains. If the chains you need are not present, click **Add Chains** to include additional chains for your organization's use.

   <Note>After adding a chain, all its supported tokens will be available for deposit and withdrawal in your wallets.</Note>
