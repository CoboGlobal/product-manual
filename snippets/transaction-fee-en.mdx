When you initiate a transfer, transaction fees (on-chain network fees) are charged to pay for the cost of executing the transaction on the blockchain.
- Fee source: By default, the fee is deducted from the source wallet you use for the withdrawal. If you have configured [Fee Station](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction) to pay transaction fees, the fee will be deducted from Fee Station.
- Fee models: Different chains adopt different fee models. For example, Ethereum supports both EIP-1559 and Legacy. To learn how fees are calculated on each chain, see [Transaction fee models](/en/portal/transfers/fee-model).
- Fee formula and parameters: Hover over the question mark icon next to **Network Fee** <img src="/en/images/common/icon_question_circle.svg" className="icon" alt="question mark icon" /> to view the fee formula for that chain.

- Transfer speed: You can choose different speeds (slow, recommended, fast). The system automatically maps a corresponding fee tier.
- Custom settings: Click the settings button (gear icon) to adjust configurable fee parameters and ensure the actual fee does not exceed your cap.
