## Key features

### An all-in-one wallet platform

Cobo Portal combines all four wallet technologies in one platform with state-of-the-art security architecture and the industry’s widest coverage of chains and tokens.

- [Custodial Wallets](/cobo-portal/wallets/custodial-wallet/introduction): Custodial Wallets utilize advanced encryption techniques and risk control engines to ensure that your funds are protected against unauthorized access and potential attacks. It implements a robust 3-tier (hot-warm-cold) private key storage architecture with 95% of funds securely stored in cold wallets and only 5% in hot and warm wallets.

Cobo Portal offers two types of MPC Wallets: Organization-Controlled Wallets, providing organizations with complete control of their own funds or their end users’ assets, and User-Controlled Wallets, giving end users full control of their digital assets.
