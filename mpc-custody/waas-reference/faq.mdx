  <Accordion title="What do `coin`, `display_code`, and `description` separately mean in the interface?">
    `coin` is Cobo’s internal coin code, which uniquely identifies each coin, while `display_code ` is the ticker symbol of
    a coin (not unique, changeable, for reference only ). ` description ` indicates the full name of a coin (not unique,
    changeable, for reference only ).For example: Tron was an ERC-20 token before launching its own mainnet and token. The
    ERC-20 and Tron mainnet tokens would share the same `display_code` and `description`, but have different `coin` values.

  <Accordion title="What do `amount` and `abs_amount` mean in the interface?">
    In the cryptocurrency world, each coin has a smallest unit. For example, Bitcoin’s smallest unit is Satoshi; 1 BTC =
    100,000,000 Satoshi. Cobo expresses amounts in terms of the smallest unit of the coin. This is to avoid problems caused
    by the misuse of floating numbers. Therefore, when transferring 1 BTC, the amount in the transaction is 100,000,000. In
    other words, `abs_amount` is used to indicate the same thing in real numbers. Clients may configure according to their
    own preferences. The conversion relation between them is: **abs_amount = amount / pow(10, decimal)**
