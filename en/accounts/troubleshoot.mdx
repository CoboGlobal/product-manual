## Difference Between Cobo Accounts and Cobo Portal account

**Cobo Accounts** and **Cobo Portal** are two separate account systems, but they are interconnected:  

- [**Cobo Accounts**](https://accounts.cobo.com/): This is the unified identity account for Cobo, mainly used for authentication and security management (such as password and MFA setup).
- **Cobo Portal**: This is Coboâ€™s digital asset wallet platform. When a user is invited to join an organization on Cobo Portal, creating the Cobo Portal member account will also create a Cobo Accounts account at the same time.

## Reinviting a deleted Cobo Portal member

As explained above, Cobo Accounts and Cobo Portal are two separate account systems, but they are interconnected.**

When a user accepts an invitation to join a Cobo Portal organization for the first time, a Cobo Accounts account is automatically created for them, and MFA is set up during the process.

If they are later removed from the Cobo Portal organization, the Cobo Portal membership is deleted, but the MFA information in **Cobo Accounts** remains. Therefore, when the same email is invited again as a Cobo Portal member, the system will require an MFA code. If the user no longer has access to the MFA, they will not be able to join the organization.

Solutions:  
- Use a different email address for the new invitation;  
- Or contact Cobo's customer support at [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) to reset MFA.  

## Forgot the login password for my Cobo Accounts
If you have chosen to use your email and password for logins and have forgotten your password, please click **Forgot password?** on the [Cobo Accounts login page](https://accounts.cobo.com/). You will need to complete an email verification and proceed to reset your password.

For security purposes, if you enter an incorrect password consecutively more than 10 times, your Cobo Accounts will be temporarily frozen. To unfreeze your account, click **Forgot password?** and follow the steps to reset your password.
