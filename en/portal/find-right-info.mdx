Our documentation is organized into two separate sites — Product Manuals and Developer Hub — to help you quickly find the information you need. Each site serves different audiences and focuses on different types of content.

- [Product Manual](/en/portal/introduction): Focuses on how to use Cobo Portal, the web interface of Cobo services, for managing wallets, assets, and transactions.  
- [Developer Hub](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/overview/introduction): Focuses on how to integrate and use Cobo WaaS (Wallet-as-a-Service), including APIs and SDKs for wallet creation, key management, and blockchain interactions.
