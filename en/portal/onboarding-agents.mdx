## What are Cobo Portal onboarding agents?

Onboarding agents are a group of collaborating agents invoked by the [Cobo AI Assistant](/en/ai/introduction#cobo-ai-assistant) during new-user onboarding. They continuously detect your configuration progress and system status, provide clear step-by-step guidance, progress updates, and explanations, and help you complete the essential onboarding steps smoothly.

Onboarding agents will suggest the right steps but will not automatically advance critical processes. They act as an on-demand onboarding helper.

**What is an agent?**  

An agent is an intelligent tool the AI assistant automatically invokes for a specific task scenario. Different Agents handle different types of tasks.

## Target users and scenarios

Onboarding agents are designed for free-trial teams created through self-service registration. Team members have not completed the onboarding flow yet and need to use MPC Wallets.

Typical target users include:

- Newly created organization admins who need to configure wallets and invite members
- Team members using Cobo Portal for the first time who need to set up Cobo Guard and other security configurations 
- Team members who need to revisit or finish key configurations
- Users who are unsure which operations are available in their current state or what to do next

## Tasks they can help with

Onboarding agents work together to help with the following tasks:

- Answer common questions about Cobo products and configuration flows by referencing product documentation  
- Guide new MPC Wallet users through the onboarding checklist, including:
  - Downloading Cobo Guard and linking their device
  - Inviting organization members and assigning user roles
  - Setting up MPC Wallets, such as creating Vaults, creating the Main Key, creating and backing up key shares, and creating wallets
- Explain the meaning of your organization's risk-control policies
- Guide you through deposit and withdrawal flows and highlight related operations and precautions

<Info>
During a conversation, you might see different agents being invoked. This indicates which agent is handling the current task—for example, the Member Invitation Agent handles member invitations, while the Cobo Guard Setup Agent guides the Cobo Guard setup. These Agents switch and collaborate as needed; you do not need to switch them manually.

## How to use

After [signing up and logging in to Cobo Portal](/en/portal/sign-up), open the **Cobo AI Assistant** chat window from the lower-left corner of Cobo Portal.

For eligible new users, the Cobo AI Assistant invokes the onboarding agents to interact with you in a **conversational, staged** way. The system fetches your current configuration status and provides relevant guidance, helping you complete setups and operations. You can ask questions or describe your goal in natural language, and the Cobo AI Assistant will respond based on the current context.
