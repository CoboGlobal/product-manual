<Note>Transaction policies are an important security measure for your organization. It is recommended to strictly configure these policies, especially for large withdrawal scenarios, to avoid high-risk situations such as having no transaction policies, having transactions that are not covered by a transaction policy, automatically approving all transactions, or allowing the same role to both withdraw and approve transactions.</Note>

<Note>The following documentation explains how to set up message signing policies with the **Initiators**, **Message Types**, or **EIP-712 Message Content** conditions. For Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; message signing policies, see [Risk controls for Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; message signing](/en/portal/risk-controls/safe-risk-controls).</Note>

## Create a message signing policy
1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies** in the main menu on the left-hand side.
3. Click **Create Policy** > **Message Signing**.

4. On the **Create Message Signing Policy** page, enter a **Policy Name**. The name should not exceed 30 characters.

5. Select applicable networks. 
6. Select the wallets under **Applicable Wallets** that are applicable to the policy you are about to create. Select addresses. The following wallet types support message signing policies:
   - Custodial Wallets
     - Web3 Wallets
   - MPC Wallets
     - Organization-Controlled Wallets
     - User-Controlled Wallets

     You can also specify addresses under the selected wallets as applicable addresses for the policy.

7. Under **If**, click **+ Add Condition** to select a condition template. You can add one or more conditions to each policy. If multiple conditions are applied, the policy will be triggered only if the request satisfies all conditions.

     <Note>You can combine multiple field checks in a single policy. The matching logic is **AND**: the policy is triggered only when all configured checks are satisfied.</Note>

     <Info>For the condition **Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; message signing**, see [Risk controls for Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; message signing](/en/portal/risk-controls/safe-risk-controls).</Info>

     **Initiators**: The policy will be triggered only if the request is initiated by selected entities.

       <img src="/en/images/risk-controls/initiator.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"/>

     **Message Types**: The policy will be triggered only if the message type is selected.

       <img src="/en/images/risk-controls/message-type.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"/>

     **EIP-712 Message Content**: The policy will be triggered only when an EIP-712 signing request matches the rule you configure. This condition allows you to perform fine-grained checks on the EIP-712 domain and message body to better control signing risk.

     <Note>You can configure **EIP-712 Message Content** only when you select EVM networks as applicable networks.</Note>

8. Under **Then**, select the action to be taken if the policy is triggered (i.e., **Auto Approval**, **Auto Rejection**, and **Approval Quorum**), then click **Next**.
     - **Auto Approval**: Requests meeting the above conditions will be automatically approved.
     - **Auto Rejection**: Requests meeting the above conditions will be automatically rejected.
     - **Approval Quorum**: Requests meeting the above conditions will require a specified number of approvals to proceed. Click **+ Select Approvers** to add one or more team members as approvers. You can select by **User Roles** or **Users**. Then, set the approval quorum.

9. Review the policy you just configured, then click **Next**.
10. Review the order of your policies. Transactions will be matched with policies in the list based on their priority order.
       - Once a higher-priority policy is triggered, subsequent policies will no longer be triggered.
       - By default, the newly created policy will be placed at the top of the policy list and highlighted. You can change the order by dragging and dropping.
11. Click **Submit** and complete the 2FA verification.

Depending on your organization's governance policies, an approval workflow may be triggered. After approval, the message signing policy will take effect.
