   - Batch upload addresses
      1. Download the template file, which outlines the format requirements for uploading addresses. The template includes columns for **Address** and **Label**, where you can input address data and labels (labels are optional and limited to 100 characters). The system prioritizes labels from the uploaded file, and if no label is provided in the uploaded file, it will automatically sync labels from the Address Book.
      2. Click **Choose File** to select and upload your address file. Please ensure that the file is in CSV format and does not exceed 1MB in size.
      3. Upon successful upload, the name of the uploaded file will be displayed. If you want to replace the currently uploaded file with a new one, click **Choose File** again.
         <Note>If the uploaded file contains addresses that already exist in the current address list, the system will automatically filter out these duplicate addresses, retaining only the new addresses.</Note>
      4. Click **Upload** and, if required, complete the 2FA verification.

   - Manually add addresses
      1. Click **Add Address**.
      2. In the pop-up window, enter an address and optionally add a label for each address (limited to 100 characters). To add more than one address, click **+ Add**.
         <Info>
         - If the address entered already exists in the address list or has been added to the current pop-up window, an error message will appear and the addition will fail.
         - If the address already exists in the Address Book with a label, the system will automatically fill in that label, which you can modify.
         </Info>
      3. Click **Submit** and, if required, complete the 2FA verification.

## Managing address labels in address lists

Transaction policy address lists support adding labels to each address, enhancing address identification and management efficiency.

You can set labels when batch uploading or manually adding addresses. For addresses already added, you can **update** their labels. Updates take effect immediately after completing MFA verification.

### Address labels in Address Lists vs. Address Book

**Differences between Address Lists and Address Book**:
- [**Address Book**](/en/portal/address-book/introduction): Global address information storage, typically maintained by withdrawal operators, used for quick address lookup during transfers.
- **Address Lists**: White/blacklists for transaction policies, typically managed by internal risk control or security operations specialists, used to establish transaction legitimacy rules.

**Label synchronization mechanism**:
   - **When first adding addresses**:
      - Batch upload: The system prioritizes labels from the uploaded file, and if no label is provided in the uploaded file, it will automatically sync labels from the Address Book.
      - Manual addition: If the address already exists in the Address Book with a label, the system will automatically fill in that label, which you can modify.
   - **When changing labels**: Labels in transaction policy address lists and the Address Book are independent of each other. Changing a label in one place does not affect the label in the other.
