To provide baseline security and simplify the initial setup process, Cobo Portal automatically activates a set of default transaction policies when the first Admin of a new organization activates their account. These policies are designed to cover common risk scenarios, reducing the complexity of initial configuration and minimizing potential gaps in coverage.

There are standard default transaction policies applied to all organizations, and specific sets tailored for different customer profiles.

## General default policy set

This is the standard set of policies activated for most new organizations:

| Priority | Policy Content                        | Policy Type    | Applicable Wallets | Condition                                 | Action                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1 (High) | High-value token transfer - approval | Token Transfer | All wallets        | Any token with a price \> 10,000 USD per tx | Require 1 approval from Admins |
| 2        | Regular token transfer - auto approval | Token Transfer | All wallets        | Any token with a price \<= 10,000 USD per tx | Auto approval                  |
| 3 (Low)  | All transactions - auto rejection    | General Policy | All wallets        | Any transaction                           | Auto rejection                 |

This configuration ensures that:
- Large token transfers (\> $10,000) require Admin approval.
- Smaller token transfers (\<= $10,000) are automatically approved.
- All other transaction types (e.g., contract calls, message signing) are automatically rejected by default, requiring specific policies to be created if needed.

## Profile-specific default policy sets

For certain customer profiles with distinct operational needs, Cobo may activate a more tailored set of default policies.

### Default policy set for exchanges

This is the set of policies focused on common exchange security concerns:

| Priority | Policy Content                        | Policy Type    | Applicable Wallets | Condition                                                                                                         | Action                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1 (High) | High-value token transfer approval | Token Transfer | All wallets        | Any token with a price > 10,000 USD per tx                                                                        | Require 1 approval from Admins |
| 2        | Web token transfer approval        | Token Transfer | All wallets        | Initiator is any web user                                                                                         | Require 1 approval from Admins |
| 3        | Token transfer time-based limit    | Token Transfer | All wallets        | Amounts across all wallets:<br/>- Any token with a price > 100,000 USD in 1 hour<br/>- Any token with a price > 500,000 USD in 24 hours | Require 1 approval from Admins |
| 4        | Regular token transfer - auto approval | Token Transfer | All wallets        | Any token with a price \<= 10,000 USD per tx                                                                       | Auto approval                  |
| 5 (Low)  | All transactions - auto rejection    | General Policy | All wallets        | Any transaction                                                                                                   | Auto rejection                 |

In addition to the general policies introduced in the last section, this set specifically requires Admin approval for:
- Any token transfer initiated from the Cobo Portal web interface.
- Token transfers exceeding hourly or daily velocity limits.

### Default policy set for Web3 clients

This is a set of policies designed for clients with on-chain interaction requirements:

| Priority | Policy Content                        | Policy Type    | Applicable Wallets | Condition                                                                                                         | Action                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1 (High) | High-value token transfer approval | Token Transfer | All wallets | Any token with a price > 10,000 USD per tx | Require 1 approval from Admins |
| 2 | Regular token transfer - auto approval | Token Transfer | All wallets | Any token with a price <= 10,000 USD per tx | Auto approval |
| 3 | Tokenization app contract call | Contract Call | All wallets | Tokenization app initiates a transaction | Auto approval |
| 4 | General contract call approval | Contract Call | All wallets | Any transaction | Require 1 approval from Admins |
| 5 (Low) | All transactions - auto rejection | General Policy | All wallets | Any transaction | Auto rejection |
