## Introduction

Security confirmation is a mechanism within Cobo's risk control system. When an operation triggers Cobo's internal risk control rules, the system automatically initiates a security confirmation process, prompting designated approvers in your organization to verify and confirm the operation.

Once configured, if the system detects potential risks, such as large withdrawals, abnormal operation frequency, or risky recipient addresses, it will send a security confirmation request to the designated approvers via the Cobo Guard App. Approvers can review the details and choose approve or reject directly on Cobo Guard. The system will proceed or stop the operation based on the confirmation result.

Security confirmation helps teams manage critical operational risks more effectively by providing:
- A secure confirmation channel: All confirmations are handled through Cobo Guard, eliminating the risks of using unofficial communication platforms.
- Traceable audit records: Every confirmation action is logged within the system for compliance and audit purposes.
- Clear approval permissions: Only members who meet the governance policies can perform confirmations.

## Configure security confirmation policies

1. Log in to Cobo Portal, click your profile icon > **Organization**.  
2. Switch to the **Governance Policies** tab.  
3. Under the **Organization** section, find the **Perform Security Confirmation** item.  The default rule allows any one Admin or Manager to perform the security confirmation.

To modify the settings, click the **More** icon in the action column and select **Edit**.  
Once saved, the system will automatically trigger the security confirmation process when an operation meets Cobo's internal risk control rules, sending confirmation requests to the designated approvers.

Configuration tips:
- Ensure that the selected approval rule can be executed in practice (for example, your team has enough valid Cobo Guard users).  
- It's recommended to assign confirmation permissions only to members responsible for security approvals.
