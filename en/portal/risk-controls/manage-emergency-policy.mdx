Emergency policies are designed for contingency situations. When risks are detected, create an emergency policy to immediately tighten transaction controls, enforcing auto rejection or auto quorum for all transactions across your organization. While this provides immediate protection, be sure to investigate and address the underlying risks.

<Info>The emergency policy applies to all transactions initiated from Cobo Portal, except for transfers between Sub Accounts and associated Main Accounts of Exchange Wallets.</Info>

<Note>Prerequisite: By default, permission to manage the emergency policy is restricted to Admins. You can also configure custom user roles to include this permission.</Note>

## Create an emergency policy

1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).

2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> and then click **Transaction Policies**.

3. Click **Manage Emergency Policy**.

4. In the pop-up window, select one of the following actions:
   - **Auto Rejection**: Any transaction will be automatically rejected
   - **Approval Quorum**: Any transaction will require a specified number of approvals to proceed
