After enabling auto token sweeping, the system enables two sweep strategies by default: single transaction threshold sweep and balance sweep. You can adjust the parameters of sweep strategies based on your business needs or add other sweep strategies.

The currently supported sweep strategies include:
- Single transaction threshold sweep: Triggered when a deposit amount in the deposit address reaches the set threshold.
- Balance sweep: Triggered when the token balance in the wallet reaches the set threshold.
- Scheduled sweep: Triggered at a fixed time every day to sweep all tokens in the wallet.

## Prerequisites
- You have been assigned the [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) of Operator, Manager, or Admin.
- You have [enabled auto token sweeping](/en/portal/enable-auto-sweep) for the wallet.

If you need to modify sweep strategies based on your business requirements, follow these steps:
1. Find the target wallet in the wallet list.
2. On the wallet settings page, click the **Auto Sweep Settings** icon <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/ocw/icon_sweep_settings.png" className="icon" alt="Auto Sweep Settings icon" />.
3. On the Auto Sweep Settings page, locate the **Sweep Strategy** section.
4. As needed, enable or disable sweep strategies and adjust the parameters of existing sweep strategies.
5. After configuration is complete, click the **Submit** button. A confirmation dialog will appear. Click **Confirm** and complete multi-factor authentication (MFA).
