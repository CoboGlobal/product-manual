<Note>
If your server has firewall or security group rules that restrict access by IP address, please allow the following IPs to ensure webhook and callback notifications are delivered:
- `54.201.57.0` for callbacks.
- `52.34.39.169` for webhooks.
</Note>

## Prerequisites
You have set up your webhook endpoint as described in [Set up a callback or webhook endpoint](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/set-up-endpoint).

## Steps

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click the Developer icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_developer.svg" className="icon" alt="the Developer icon" /> in the main menu.
3. Click the **WaaS 2.0** tab and then switch to the **Webhooks** tab.
4. Click **Register Webhook Endpoint** to display the following dialog.

5. Enter the URL.
6. Enter a description for the webhook endpoint.
7. Select the types of event notifications you want to subscribe to.
    <Note>For more details about the event types, refer to [Webhook event types](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/webhook-event-type#webhook-event-types).</Note>
8. Click **Register**.

Now you have registered a webhook endpoint. After registering the webhook endpoint, you cannot delete it. However, if it's no longer needed, you can revoke it, which will permanently disable its functionality.

## Next steps

After registering a webhook endpoint, you can:
- Edit the webhook endpoint's description or subscribed event types.
- Revoke the webhook endpoint to disable its functionality.
- Filter the webhook endpoint list by status or event type.
- Search for specific webhook endpoints using names or keywords.
