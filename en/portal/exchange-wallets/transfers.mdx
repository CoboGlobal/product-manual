This article explains how to deposit assets into an Exchange Wallet. In this context, a withdrawal refers to transferring assets from another wallet created on the Cobo Portal or an external address to an Exchange Wallet. 

Only Exchange Wallets (Main Account) with a trading account type of Spot or Fund support deposits. To deposit assets into an Exchange Wallet (Sub Account), you must first deposit the assets to its associated Main Account, and then transfer the assets from the Main Account to the Sub Account. To learn more about transfers between the Sub Accounts and associated Main Accounts and transfers between trading accounts, see [Transfer Within an Exchange Wallet](within-wallet).
