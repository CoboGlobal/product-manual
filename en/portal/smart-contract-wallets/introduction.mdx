<Info>Due to the Bybit security incident, Safe Wallet has suspended third-party delegate call services. As a result, Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets and related services (including on-chain transaction policies) are temporarily unavailable. However, existing wallets and on-chain transaction policies can still be used. Recovery timeline will be announced later.</Info>

## What are Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;)?

Smart contract wallets are decentralized applications (dApps) built on blockchain technology, allowing users to manage their digital assets through programmable smart contracts. These wallets give users the ability to keep their crypto assets in self-custody.

Cobo Portal’s Smart Contract Wallets support the direct creation and import of [Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;](https://safe.global/), a leading Ethereum multi-signature wallet, and provide granular on-chain access controls through Cobo Safe, a smart contract built on [Safe Modules](https://docs.safe.global/advanced/smart-account-modules).

When integrated with Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; as a plug-in, Cobo Safe enables role-based access controls, allowing you to delegate operations to externally owned accounts (EOAs). These accounts can perform specific actions authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers using just one signature, significantly improving operational efficiency. At the same time, the multi-signature mechanism of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; removes any single point of failure, ensuring the complete security of your funds.

## Key features

### Efficient single-signature fund transfers
Effortlessly execute fund transfers using a single-signature scheme, representing a boost in efficiency from the multi-signature scheme when utilizing Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.

### Off-chain and on-chain transaction policies
Exercise full control over transaction policies for your Smart Contract Wallets, extending beyond off-chain to cover on-chain transaction policies. With off-chain transaction policies, ensure robust security by setting up configurable policies for token transfers and contract calls. With on-chain transaction policies, authorize specific actions to be safely executed by Delegates, who can then sign these actions using a simple single-signature transaction.

### Seamless interactions with dApps
Easily connect to your favorite dApps with Cobo Connect—a powerful Chrome extension that serves as your gateway between Cobo Portal and the dApp ecosystem.
