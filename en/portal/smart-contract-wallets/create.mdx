<Info>Due to the Bybit security incident, Safe Wallet has suspended third-party delegate call services. As a result, Cobo's Smart Contract Wallets and related services (including on-chain transaction policies) are temporarily unavailable. However, existing wallets and on-chain transaction policies can still be used. Recovery timeline will be announced later.</Info>

## Prerequisites

- You have set up your account and complete other required steps following the [Quick start guide](/en/portal/quick-start-guide-mpc).
- You have [created](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/set-up) an MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled).
- You have been assigned the [Operator](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role or a custom role with equivalent permissions.

<Note>Currently, creating a Smart Contract Wallet on Cobo Portal is akin to setting up a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; with Cobo Safe enabled.</Note>

## Step 1: Create a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;
1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_wallet.svg" className="icon"></img> > **Smart Contract Wallets** > <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_create.svg" className="icon"></img>.
3. In the pop-up window, select a network where your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will be based.
4. Enter a name for your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
5. Select signer addresses. These addresses will be used to sign multi-sig transactions on the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
- My Wallets: Select addresses from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled).
- Address Book: Select MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled) or EOA addresses listed in your Address Book.
- Other: Manually enter EOA addresses.
6. Enter a signing threshold. The threshold in a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; specifies the number of signers required to sign a multi-sig transaction before it can be executed.
7. Enter an optional label for your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;. Please note that your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; address will only be added to the Address Book if you provide a label in this step.
8. Select an initiator address from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled). This address will be used to cover the network fee when creating your new Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
9. Click **Next**.

10. Review your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; details, including the signer addresses, signing threshold, and initiator address.
11. Confirm on your Cobo Guard that you initiated this request.
12. Your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; is successfully created. You may now proceed to Step 2 to complete the wallet setup.

## Step 2: Initialize a Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;
1. After you approve the wallet creation request on your Cobo Guard, a **Request Confirmed** window will appear. Click **OK** to begin initiating your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/request confirmed.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
2. You will be automatically redirected to the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, where you will see the initialization status of your new Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; listed as **Under Review**.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/under review.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"></img>
3. Click **Under Review** > **View**.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/step 1.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
4. You will be redirected to the Transaction History homepage.
5. Connect the initiator address you selected when creating this Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; and then sign a message. Do note that this initiator address will be used to cover the network fees associated with creating your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
6. Your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will be successfully initiated once the signing process is complete.
7. Return to the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, where the status of your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will now be automatically updated to **Setup Required**. You may now proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Set up a Delegate Key

The Delegate Key is used to initiate, but not sign, multi-sig transactions on behalf of Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers. It is a dedicated address created and assigned by Cobo.

1. On the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, click **Setup Required** > **Set Up** next to your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/step 2.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
2. Click **Set Up Delegate Key**.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/set up delegate key.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
3. If you are not the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signer:
- Click <img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/button_copy.svg" className="icon"></img> to copy the link shown in the pop-up window. Then, send it to any of your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers to sign.
- Alternatively, click **Copy All and Close** to copy all information, including the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; address, Delegate Key, and URL.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/4.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
4. If you are the Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signer:
- Navigate to the link provided and connect to your wallet associated with this Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
- In the pop-up window, review the auto-filled fields and enter a label for this Delegate Key. Then, click **Sign Message**.
- Sign a message in your connected wallet.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/5.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
5. The new Delegate Key will be displayed on the homepage. You may now proceed to Step 4.

## Step 4: Create an on-chain transaction policy
1. On the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, click **Setup Required** > **Create** next to your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;.
<img src="/en/images/smart-contract-wallet/step 3.png" className="screenshot_modal"></img>
2. Select the type of on-chain transaction policy you want to create. Note that creating an on-chain transaction policy requires you to select Delegates. Upon successful creation of this on-chain transaction policy, you authorize these Delegates to perform certain tasks (e.g., token transfers, token approvals, contract calls) using a single-signature.

3. Click **Next**.
4. Set up an on-chain transaction policy. For step-to-step guides, refer to [Create contract call policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/create-on-chain-policy).
5. Return to the Smart Contract Wallets homepage, where the status of your Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; will now be automatically updated to **Ready for use**.

#### What is a Delegate?

Delegate can either be an address from your MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled), Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets), or an EOA address. It is pre-authorized by Safe&#123;Wallet&#125; signers to perform single-signature operations, such as transferring funds or interacting with dApps. Importantly, the Delegate is responsible for handling gas fees during the execution of single-signature transactions.

On Cobo Portal, you can set up Delegates by creating on-chain transaction policies for Smart Contract Wallets. The addresses entered during setup will automatically be designated as Delegates for performing single-signature operations.
