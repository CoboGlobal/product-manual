## What is Fee Station

On different blockchains, transactions require different native tokens (gas tokens like ETH, TRX, or SOL) to pay for gas fees. This means you need to prepare and manage gas balances for each chain. If any address runs out of gas, transactions may fail.

Fee Station helps you simplify this. It’s a one-stop fee management platform on Cobo Portal. Once any member tops up the Fee Station account, it can automatically cover on-chain gas fees for all [MCP Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) or [Web3 Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/web3-wallets/introduction) transactions in your organization based on the strategy you configure.

<Note>Currently, Fee Station supports EVM and TRON chains. Solana support is coming soon.</Note>

## Who should use Fee Station

Fee Station is ideal for any Web3 team looking to simplify on-chain fee management, especially:

- **Exchanges and wallet service providers**: Centrally manage and prepay gas fees for end-user transactions, reducing operational overhead.
- **Payment service providers**: Use flat-rate or unified billing models to abstract away blockchain complexity and deliver smoother user experiences.
- **Enterprise developers using Cobo wallets**: Automate fee budgeting, track spending in real time, and receive Webhook alerts for transaction status and balance changes.

## What Fee Station can do for you

### Automatic gas fee handling

Fee Station can automatically cover gas fees for transactions initiated from MCP Wallets and Web3 Wallets. You can choose to cover fees only when the wallet balance is insufficient, or to always cover them. Once configured, the system automatically checks the condition and processes the gas fee without manual input.

### Flexible deposit options

You can deposit gas tokens directly, or simply use USD stablecoins like USDT or USDC as a unified balance. Fee Station will convert them into the required gas tokens at the time of transaction, avoiding the manual work of preparing tokens for each chain.

### Significant savings on TRON gas fees

Using Fee Station for TRON transactions can reduce your gas costs by up to 80%. Higher-volume transactions enjoy even greater discounts. Contact our sales team to learn more details.

### Unified fee settlement

In addition to covering gas fees, your Fee Station balance can also be used to settle all platform-related charges within Cobo Portal, including service fees, Cobo Bills, and commission fees. You don't need to maintain separate balances for each fee type. A single balance simplifies the billing process and gives you a clear, consolidated view of your spending.

### API and webhook integration

Fee Station offers standardized APIs and webhook support, allowing your system to access real-time fee data and receive timely notifications. This makes monitoring and operations tracking easier and more efficient.
