In the **USD / USD stablecoin** tab, you can view your current balance, deposit history, and spending records, and initiate new deposits. For supported stablecoin types, refer to [Supported Token Types](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction#supported-token-types).

2. Click your name in the bottom left corner, then select **Organization** > **Fee Station**.
3. Switch to the **USD / USD stablecoin** tab. Next to the balance, click the **Deposit** button, choose a suitable deposit method, and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deposit.

## Deposit gas tokens

You can also deposit native gas tokens on each supported chain, which can be used to cover gas fees on those chains.

In the **Gas Token** tab, you can view the balance and transaction records of gas tokens on each chain and initiate deposits. For supported gas tokens, refer to [Supported Token Types](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction#supported-token-types).
