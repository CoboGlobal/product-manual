## Configure transaction policies
<Note>If you're in the testing phase and want to quickly verify deposits and withdrawals first, you can skip this section for now and set them up later.</Note>

<Accordion title="Configure transaction policies">

[Transaction policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview) are essential measures to secure your digital asset operations. When a transaction starts, it's checked against your organization's transaction policies in sequential order. If it matches a policy's trigger condition, the specified action will be taken: auto-approve, auto-reject, or an approval quorum process.

In this guide, we'll create a policy that requires 2-of-3 Admin approval for large USDT withdrawals to non-trusted addresses. For other policy setups and advanced configurations, see [Set up token transfer policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).

### Prerequisites
- You have [invited enough members](#invite-members) to have at least 3 members in the organization and have [assigned the Admin user role](/en/portal/organization/assign-roles-to-members) to at least 3 of them.

### Configure a trusted receiving address list
First, create a list of trusted addresses that are pre-approved for withdrawals:

<Info>In our case, we will configure the system so that any large USDT withdrawals to addresses outside this trusted receiving address list will require multi-signature approval (2 out of 3 Admin signers).</Info>

1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
    - For testing, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com).
    - For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com).

2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies**.
3. Navigate to the **Address Lists** tab and click **Create List**.
<img src="/en/images/risk-controls/create-an-address-list.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"/>
4. Enter a name for your address list, then click **Confirm**.
5. Click your newly created address list, click **Add Address**, then enter your trusted addresses.
6. Click **Submit** and verify with your Google Authenticator code.

For more details on managing address lists, including batch uploads, see [Address list](/en/portal/risk-controls/address-list).

### Create the transaction policy
Now, let's set up a policy with these security rules:
- Trigger: Withdrawals over 30,000,000 USDT to non-trusted addresses
- Action: Require approval from 2 out of 3 approvers with the Admin user role.

Follow these steps:

1. In Cobo Portal, go to <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies**.
2. Click **Create Policy** > **Token Transfer**.
3. Configure the settings as shown in the screenshot:

<img src="/en/images/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets/example-policy.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Policy Created"/>

4. Click **Next** and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the policy setup.

Your policy is now active and will require 2-of-3 approval for any USDT withdrawal over 30,000,000 to non-trusted addresses. For more policy configurations and use cases, visit [Set up token transfer policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).

## What's next

### Configure transaction policies
Setting up transaction policies is a crucial security measure that enables automated and controlled transaction approvals. To configure policies, see [Configure transaction policies](#configure-transaction-policies) for detailed instructions.
