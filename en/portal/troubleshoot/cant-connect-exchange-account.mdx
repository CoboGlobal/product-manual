If you can’t connect an exchange account, make sure you’ve completed the following steps and try again:

1. Add Cobo IPs (`18.177.234.7` and `18.180.16.190`) to the whitelist in your exchange API settings, and ensure you select the correct API key type and permissions.
2. Ensure the API Key, API Secret, and passphrase are correct.
3. Ensure your exchange account is active and has no pending KYC or other issues.
4. Verify your internet connection is stable.
5. Confirm the exchange system or service is not experiencing incidents or maintenance.
