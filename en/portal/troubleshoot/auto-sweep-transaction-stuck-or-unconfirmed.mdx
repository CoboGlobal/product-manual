If an auto-sweep transaction remains unconfirmed for a long time, one common cause is network congestion and fee volatility, which can lead to an insufficient fee or slow confirmation speed.

You can try the following:

1. Locate the auto-sweep transaction in the wallet’s transaction history. If the chain/transaction supports RBF (Replace By Fee), you can accelerate it via RBF.

2. To reduce the possibility of auto-sweep transactions being stuck or confirming slowly, we recommend enabling automatic RBF for sweep transactions in [Auto token sweeping settings](/en/portal/auto-sweep-settings) and setting a reasonable fee limit, so fees can be adjusted automatically during fee spikes.

If the issue persists, please prepare the transaction hash (TxHash), chain, and token information, then contact Cobo Support (help@cobo.com) for assistance.
