Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 APIs both provide a developer environment and a production environment. We recommend testing new features in the developer environment before deploying to production.

If you cannot find the sign-up page URL, the activation link does not open, or you are unsure which environment to use, refer to the following:

1. Distinguish environment URLs
    - Developer Environment Cobo Portal URL: https://portal.dev.cobo.com/
    - Developer Environment WaaS 2.0 API Base URL: https://api.dev.cobo.com/
    - Production Environment Cobo Portal URL: https://portal.cobo.com/
    - Production Environment WaaS 2.0 API Base URL: https://api.cobo.com/

2. Accounts and organizations are not shared across environments
    - The Developer Environment and Production Environment are separate. Accounts and organization data are typically not shared. Make sure you are using the correct Cobo Portal or API base URL for the environment you were invited to / enabled for.

3. Didn’t receive the activation email or need it resent
    - Check your spam folder and any corporate email filtering rules, and verify you used the correct email address.
    - If you still cannot activate your account, contact Cobo Support (help@cobo.com) and provide your email address and organization name.
