**Applicable to: Exchange Wallets**

If your connected exchange account shows **“Connection Failed”**, **“API Not Found”**, or similar errors, it may be caused by multiple factors such as expired/deleted API keys, insufficient API permissions, exchange-side network issues, account restrictions or freezes, KYC issues, and more.

To resolve this, click <img src="/en/images/exchange-wallet/24.png" className="icon"/> to reconnect. If the issue persists, check your exchange settings and make sure your network is working, your API keys are valid and up to date, required permissions are granted, and your account is active.
