**Applicable to: Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets), MPC Wallets**

For Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets) and MPC Wallets with auto token sweeping enabled, the timing and execution strategy are managed automatically by Cobo based on internal rules. If you find that funds have arrived at the deposit address but have not been swept for some time, first confirm that the address has received the funds on-chain. Note that sweeping may be affected by network congestion, fee fluctuations, and the platform’s execution cadence.

If you need to trigger sweeping manually, you can also create an auto sweep task via the WaaS 2.0 API. Refer to [Create auto sweep task](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/autosweep/create-auto-sweep-task).
