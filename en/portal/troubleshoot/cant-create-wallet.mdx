**Applicable to: All wallets**

If you have trouble creating a new wallet, consider the following possibilities:

1. Insufficient permissions
    - Issue: You may not have the required permission to create a wallet.
    - Solution: Make sure you have the [required permissions](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions), or contact your admin.

2. Network issues / service downtime
    - Issue: Your network may be unstable, or Cobo services may be under maintenance or temporarily unavailable.
    - Solution: Make sure your network is stable and Cobo services are not under maintenance. Check Cobo system status [here](https://status.cobo.com/).
