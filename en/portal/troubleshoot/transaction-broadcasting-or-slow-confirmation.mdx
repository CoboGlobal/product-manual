**Applicable to: All wallets**

If a transaction stays in **Broadcasting** for a long time, or on-chain confirmations progress slowly, it usually means the transaction has been broadcast to the network but is still waiting to be included/confirmed. Confirmation requirements vary by chain, and network congestion can slow down confirmations.

We recommend checking the following in order:

1. Confirm the on-chain status in a block explorer
    - If the explorer shows the transaction is not included yet, or has a low confirmation count, it is usually related to network congestion or a low fee.
    - If the explorer shows the transaction is successful and has enough confirmations, but the status in Cobo Portal has not updated, refer to [Deposit not credited](/en/portal/troubleshoot/deposit-not-credited).

2. Consider acceleration options if the chain supports it
    - For networks/wallets that support transaction replacement (for example, Replace By Fee, RBF), you may be able to accelerate confirmations by increasing the fee when eligible.
    - If you are not sure whether acceleration is supported or how to proceed, contact Cobo Support for assistance.
