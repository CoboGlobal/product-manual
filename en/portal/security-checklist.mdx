## Risk controls

Cobo Portal offers a variety of risk control mechanisms designed to address the challenges in storing, managing, and transferring digital assets.

### User roles and permissions

User roles consist of predefined sets of rules that enable you to assign specific permissions to designated members within your organization.

- Configure at least two [Admins](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) to ensure cross-verification and mutual backup. Other roles can be assigned appropriately based on actual needs. 
- It is not recommended to assign multiple roles to the same member.

For more details, see [User roles and permissions](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions).

### Transaction policies

You can effortlessly create and edit both on-chain and off-chain transaction policies, and automate how each transaction will be handled by setting up an approval action. 
<Note>On-chain transaction policies are governed by smart contracts on the blockchain networks, and only applies to Smart Contract Wallets. Off-chain transaction policies, on the other hand, are managed by the backend system of Cobo Portal and apply to all wallet types.</Note>

It is recommended to strictly configure transaction policies, especially for large withdrawal scenarios. Particular attention should be given to token transfer policies in off-chain transaction policies to avoid high-risk situations, such as:
- having no transaction policies
- having transactions that are not covered by a transaction policy
- automatically approving all transactions
- allowing the same role to both withdraw and approve transactions

For more details, see [Introduction to transaction policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview).

### Governance policies

Governance policies determine the approval rules under which an operation will be approved or rejected. 

The following list includes crucial operations in Cobo Portal, and it is recommended to configure two or more [Admins](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) for their approval.

- Invite members
- Change members' user roles
- Edit governance policies
- Authorize Cobo Portal apps
- Change Cobo Portal apps's permissions
- Change Cobo Portal apps's workflows
- Manage transaction policies
- Manage addresses in Address List
- Manage API keys

For more details, see [Introduction to governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-intro).

## Admin authentication
To enhance security and reduce the risk of account compromise, it is strongly recommended that all Admins enable at least two authentication methods, with Cobo Guard as one of them.

Recommended combinations include:
- Cobo Guard and Google Authenticator (GA)
- Cobo Guard and security key

<Note>Install GA on a different device than Cobo Guard to prevent loss of access if one device is lost.</Note>

## API key settings

Admins and Operators can register API keys on the Developer Console and assign specific user roles, permissions, and IP whitelists.

- Use permanent API keys, set up the IP whitelist and configure the callback endpoint.
- Assign the wallet scope properly, and avoid selecting **any type wallet**.

For more details, see [Register API Key](/en/portal/developer-console/create-api-key).

## MPC Wallets-related configurations

### Private keys

With MPC technology, private key shares are individually generated within separate secure environments, encrypted, and divided amongst multiple parties. A set of key shares form a private key.

- To ensure the safety and recoverability of your assets, create at least one Signing Key and one Recovery Key in addition to the Main Key.
- For Main and Recovery Keys, choose high-ranking executives in your organization as key share holders, preferably with [Viewer](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) roles to minimize their involvement in daily operations. For Signing Groups, key share holders can be selected from various organizational levels based on operational needs and security considerations.

For more details, see [Private key overview](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview).

### Key share backup and recovery

After you have successfully generated a key share, you can back it up to ensure its safety and recoverability. Securely store the recovery phrase and encrypted database password for key share backup. If lost, you will need to recover the key shares using the Recovery Key, if one has been set up.

For more details, see [Mobile signer backup key share instructions](/en/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares#backup-private-key-shares) and [Server signer backup key share instructions](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/key-shares-backup).
