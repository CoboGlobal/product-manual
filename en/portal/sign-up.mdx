## Notes

1. You will automatically receive a 14-day free trial after registration and organization creation.
2. The free trial will automatically end after 14 days, with no extra or hidden fees.
3. If you wish to continue using Cobo Portal, the system will guide you to choose an appropriate paid plan when the trial expires.
4. If you do not intend to continue after the trial, please ensure that no assets remain in your wallet, as you will lose access to Cobo services once the trial ends.
