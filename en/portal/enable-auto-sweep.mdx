This guide explains how to enable the auto token sweeping feature for MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) or Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets) on Cobo Portal. For more details about auto token sweeping, refer to [Overview](/en/portal/auto-sweep-overview).

## Prerequisites

- For MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets):
  - You have created an MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled Wallet) and set it up as described in [Overview](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/set-up).
  - Due to the high volume of consolidation transactions and their concentrated execution time, please ensure you have set up at least one [server signer](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-overview) as a key share holder of your [Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group) or [Signing Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group).
  - If you use a TSS Node Callback server for risk control review, you can add the sweep-to address to the server's whitelist to automatically approve sweep transactions. For more details, refer to the sample project in [Auto token sweeping implementation](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/risk-control-best-practices#auto-sweeping-implementation).
- For Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets):
  - You have created a Custodial Wallet and set it up as described in [Set up Web3 Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/web3-wallets/set-up).
- You have been assigned the [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) of Admin, Operator, or Manager.
- Gas fees apply to the withdrawal part of the sweep transaction. It is recommended to enable [Fee Station](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction) to automatically supplement the gas fee when the deposit address balance is insufficient. Otherwise, you will need to ensure sufficient main chain coin balance at the deposit address.

## Steps

The following steps use MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) as an example. The steps for Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets) are similar.

### For a new wallet

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault.
4. Click **Create Wallet**.
5. Name your wallet, then enable the **Auto-Sweep** switch.

    <Warning>Currently, once enabled, the auto token sweeping feature cannot be disabled.</Warning>

6. Click **Create**.

Now you have successfully created a new Organization-Controlled Wallet with auto token sweeping enabled. The wallet has a icon indicating that the feature is enabled as the following screenshot shows.

### For an existing wallet

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault.
4. Choose the wallet that you want to enable auto token sweeping for.
5. Click the **Turn On Auto-Sweep** icon <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/ocw/icon_sweep.png" className="icon" alt="The Turn On Auto-Sweep icon" /> in the **Action** column.
6. In the **Turn On Auto-Sweep** dialog, click **Confirm**.

    <Warning>Currently, once enabled, the auto token sweeping feature cannot be disabled.</Warning>

6. Verify your identify using an MFA method.

Now you have successfully enabled auto token sweeping for the wallet. The wallet has a icon indicating that the feature is enabled as the following screenshot shows.

## Changes after enabling auto token sweeping

### Sweep-to addresses

Once you enable auto token sweeping, Cobo automatically generates a dedicated sweep-to address for each enabled chain in the wallet. These addresses are system-assigned and cannot be manually specified. When any deposit address receives tokens, the system will automatically and periodically sweep these tokens to the corresponding sweep-to address through sweep transactions. 

<Note>Gas fees apply to the withdrawal part of the sweep transaction. It is recommended to enable [Fee Station](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction) to automatically supplement the gas fee when the deposit address balance is insufficient. Otherwise, you will need to ensure sufficient main chain coin balance at the deposit address.</Note>

The wallet addresses are displayed under two tabs: the **Deposit** tab shows previously created deposit addresses, while the **Sweep-To** tab shows the sweep addresses.

<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/ocw/auto-sweep-address-list.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Address list" />

### Balances
In a wallet with auto token sweeping enabled, token balances are separated into **balance** and **withdrawable balance** columns. Hover over a token's total balance to see the swept balance and the balances with sweeping in progress, and hover over a token's withdrawable balance to view the sweep-to address.

<img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/ocw/auto-sweep-token-list.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Token list" />

- Total balance: This represents the sum of your withdrawable balance and balance with sweeping in progress in your wallet.
- Withdrawable balance/Swept balance: This is the part of your balance located in the sweep-to address that is readily available for withdrawal, contract calls, and other transaction operations.
- Sweeping in progress: This refers to the part of your balance that has not yet been moved to the sweep-to address, meaning it is not currently available for withdrawal and other transaction operations. This includes tokens that are in the process of being swept and those that have not yet been initiated for sweeping.

### Transaction record type
When sweeping occurs, two transaction records are generated:
- For deposit addresses: displayed as **Withdrawal-Sweep**.
- For sweep-to addresses: displayed as **Deposit-Sweep**.

## Optional next steps

### Change sweep-to addresses  
If your setup changes, switch networks, or the current address is compromised or tainted by suspicious funds, you can [change sweep-to addresses](/en/portal/change-sweep-address) as needed.

### Enable deposit address transactions  
By default, deposit addresses cannot initiate withdrawals, contract calls, staking, OTC trades, or smart contract delegations. To manually enable these capabilities for deposit addresses, follow these steps in [Enable deposit address transactions](/en/portal/deposit-address-transaction).

### Filter wallets by feature status  
You can filter wallets by their **Auto-Sweep Enabled** status in the wallet list to quickly identify which wallets have the feature enabled.
