This guide explains how to enable the auto token sweeping feature for MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) or Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets) on Cobo Portal. For more details about auto token sweeping, refer to [Overview](/en/portal/auto-sweep-overview).

## Prerequisites

- For MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets):
  - You have created an MPC Wallet (Organization-Controlled Wallet) and set it up as described in [Overview](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/set-up).
  - Due to the high volume of consolidation transactions and their concentrated execution time, please ensure you have set up at least one [server co-signer](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-overview) as your [Main Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group) or [Signing Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group).
  - If you use a TSS Node Callback server for risk control review, you can add the sweep-to address to the server's whitelist to automatically approve sweep transactions. For more details, refer to the sample project in [Auto token sweeping implementation](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/risk-control-best-practices#auto-sweeping-implementation).
- For Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets):
  - You have created a Custodial Wallet and set it up as described in [Set up Web3 Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/web3-wallets/set-up).
- You have been assigned the role of "Admin", "Operator", "Manager" or an equivalent [role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) with the permission "Edit Auto-Sweep".
- Gas fees apply to the withdrawal part of the sweep transaction. It is recommended to enable [Fee Station](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction) to automatically supplement the gas fee when the deposit address balance is insufficient. Otherwise, you will need to ensure sufficient main chain coin balance at the deposit address.

## Steps

The following steps use MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) as an example. The steps for Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets) are similar.

### For a new wallet

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault.
4. Click **Create Wallet**.
5. Name your wallet, then enable the **Auto-Sweep** switch.

    <Warning>Currently, once enabled, the auto token sweeping feature cannot be disabled.</Warning>

6. Click **Create**.

Now you have successfully created a new Organization-Controlled Wallet with auto token sweeping enabled. The wallet has a icon indicating that the feature is enabled as the following screenshot shows.

### For an existing wallet

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault.
4. Choose the wallet that you want to enable auto token sweeping for.
5. Click the **Turn On Auto-Sweep** icon <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/ocw/icon_sweep.png" className="icon" alt="The Turn On Auto-Sweep icon" /> in the **Action** column.

    <Warning>Currently, once enabled, the auto token sweeping feature cannot be disabled.</Warning>

6. Verify your identify using an MFA method.

Now you have successfully enabled auto token sweeping for the wallet. The wallet has a icon indicating that the feature is enabled as the following screenshot shows.

## Changes after enabling this feature

Once auto token sweeping is enabled, the following changes apply:

### Capabilities of original deposit addresses and sweep-to addresses
- deposit addresses: Now deposit addresses can only receive funds and initiate sweep transactions to the designated sweep-to address. They are not enabled for withdrawals, contract calls, staking, OTC transactions, or financial product transactions, nor can they act as delegate addresses for Smart Contract Wallets.
- sweep-to addresses: sweep-to addresses remain fully functional and can perform all transaction types. You can [change sweep-to addresses](/en/portal/change-sweep-address) as needed.

### Token list
In a wallet with auto token sweeping enabled, you can view your token balances in two columns: total balance and withdrawable balance. Hover over a token's total balance to see the swept balance and the balances with sweeping in progress, and hover over a token's withdrawable balance to view the sweep-to address.

    <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/ocw/auto-sweep-token-list.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Token list" />

    - Total balance: This represents the sum of your withdrawable balance and balance with sweeping in progress in your wallet.
    - Withdrawable balance/Swept balance: This is the part of your balance located in the sweep-to address that is readily available for withdrawal, contract calls, and other transaction operations.
    - Sweeping in progress: This refers to the part of your balance that has not yet been moved to the sweep-to address, meaning it is not currently available for withdrawal and other transaction operations. This includes tokens that are in the process of being swept and those that have not yet been initiated for sweeping.

### Address list
You can find addresses organized into two tabs: **Deposit** and **Sweep-to**. The **Deposit** tab displays previously created deposit addresses, while the **Sweep-to** tab lists addresses created by Cobo for sweep transactions.

### Wallet list
You can filter wallets by their **Auto-Sweep Enabled** status to easily identify which wallets have the feature turned on or off.

    <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/ocw/auto-sweep-wallet-filter.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Wallet filter" />

### Transaction history
When an auto token sweeping operation occurs, you will see two transaction records. For deposit addresses, it's recorded as a **Withdrawal-Sweep** transaction. For sweep-to addresses, it's recorded as a **Deposit-Sweep** transaction.
You can view and filter sweep transactions in transaction history page as the following screenshot shows:
