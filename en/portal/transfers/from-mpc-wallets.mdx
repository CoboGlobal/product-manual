This article explains the withdrawal process for MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) and guides you through initiating withdrawals in Cobo Portal.

## Prerequisites

- It's recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer) to ensure transaction security.
- You have [deposited funds](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers) into the Organization-Controlled Wallet.

## Withdrawal process

The diagram below outlines the withdrawal flow from an Organization-Controlled Wallet via both Cobo Portal and the WaaS API.

<img src="/en/images/transfers/mpc-withdrawal-process.svg" className="diagram" alt="The steps involved in a withdrawal from an Organization-Controlled Wallet"/>

1. **Initiate a withdrawal request**: A spender initiates a withdrawal request via Cobo Portal or [the WaaS API](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ocw#withdraw-tokens).
2. **Double confirmation**:
   - For Cobo Portal initiated withdrawals: Confirm the withdrawal on [Cobo Guard](/en/guard/introduction).
   - For WaaS API initiated withdrawals: Your [callback endpoint](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/webhooks-callbacks/introduction) needs to respond with "ok" to confirm.
3. **[Risk control](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview)**: If configured, transaction policies in Cobo Portal assess the withdrawal request. When manual review is required, approvers must approve the transaction on Cobo Guard.
4. **Sign the transaction**: A [signer](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group#create-a-main-group) will be selected to sign the transaction based on their online status and other criteria. Inform your mobile signer or check if your server signer is online. For details, see [Inform mobile signers or check server signer status](#inform-mobile-signers-or-check-server-signer-status).
   
   <Note>If you use a [server signer](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/tss-node-overview) with the [TSS Node callback mechanism](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/callback-server-overview), your TSS Node callback server must first approve the signing request before the server signer can proceed with transaction signing.</Note>
5. **Broadcast the transaction**: Cobo creates the transaction and broadcasts it to the network.


## Initiate a withdrawal

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).

2. Click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon"></img> in the main menu on the left hand side.

    <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button-location.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
 
    <Note>On Cobo Portal, tokens can only be transferred to one destination at a time. To transfer tokens to multiple addresses, use the [Transfer token API operation](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/transfer-token).</Note>

3. Select **MPC Wallets > Org-Controlled Wallets** as the source wallet. For the wallet address, select from the drop-down menu or search by address, vault name, wallet name, or label. MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets) created via both Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 API will be listed.

4. Select the token type and network for the transfer. Selection is limited to tokens included in your organization's subscription package. To enable a new token type (fees apply), see step 1 to 6 on [Deposit from external wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/transfers#deposit-from-external-wallets).

5. Select a recipient address from your Address Book or your wallets on Cobo Portal, or manually enter an address.
    - **Address Book**<img src="/en/images/common/icon_address_book.svg" className="icon" alt="Address Book icon" />: Only addresses associated with the blockchain network of the selected token will be listed.
    - **My Wallets**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.

6. Enter the transfer amount. Please note that for DOT, XRP, or KSM tokens, a minimum balance must be maintained in the selected MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets). For DOT, reserve a minimum of 1 DOT; for XRP, 10 XRP; and for KSM, 0.000333333 KSM.

    <Info>The maximum amount you can transfer is affected by transaction fees, available balance, and locked amounts: <ul><li>(Withdrawal amount + transaction fee) \> available balance: The withdrawal request cannot be submitted.</li><li>(Withdrawal amount + transaction fee) ≤ (current balance - locked amount): Your withdrawal request will be processed immediately.</li><li>(current balance - locked amount) \< (withdrawal amount + transaction fee) ≤ available balance: You can successfully submit a withdrawal request, but your transaction will be queued.</li></ul>For more information, please refer to [Balances and transaction amounts for MPC Wallets](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/balance-amounts).</Info>

9. Click **Submit**.
10. Approve the request on your Cobo Guard. If it is a new address not found in your Address Book or any of your wallets created on Cobo Portal, you will be prompted to add the address to your Address Book.

## Inform mobile signers or check server signer status

After the transaction is confirmed, the transaction will be sent to signes. The transaction will remain pending until it receives the necessary signature. 

- For **mobile signers**, notify them to open their Cobo Guard to sign the transaction.
      
- For **server signers**, you can check if they are online through Cobo Portal:

    1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
    2. Click <img src="/en/images/transfers/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
    3. Select your vault and then click the **Manage Share Management** icon <img src="/en/images/transfers/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
    4. On the **Key Share Management** page, check if there is a green dot on the avatar of the server signer:
        - 🟢 Green dot: The server is online and ready to sign transactions
        - No dot: The server is offline and cannot sign transactions.
        
        <img src="/en/images/transfers/main-group-active.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Key Share Management page showing server signer status"/>
      
      After the transaction is signed, Cobo creates and broadcasts it to the network. The token transfer may take some time to complete, depending on network conditions.
