description: Learn how major blockchain networks calculate transaction fees and how to configure the right parameters for your transfers.

In blockchain networks, transaction fees determine not only whether a transfer is confirmed but also how quickly it is processed. Since each network adopts a different calculation model, understanding these rules is essential for making informed configuration choices.

## EVM chains

### EIP-1559 model

Some EVM chains support [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559). Currently supported chains include:  
- Ethereum Mainnet  
- Sepolia Testnet  
- Scroll Mainnet  
- Base  
- BNB Smart Chain  
- Polygon  
- Sonic  
- Berachain  

In the EIP-1559 model, the estimated transaction fee is calculated as: (base fee + priority fee) * gas limit

| Parameter           | Description                                                                                                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Base fee     | The maximum amount you are willing to pay per gas unit to execute the transaction on-chain.                                |
| Priority fee           | The maximum additional fee per gas unit paid to miners/validators to prioritize your transaction. |
| Gas limit           | The maximum number of gas units you are willing to spend to execute the transaction or run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Different operations consume different amounts of gas units. |

<Note>For both Legacy and EIP-1559 fee models, an additional fee is charged when submitting transaction calldata to L1 (Layer 1).</Note>

You can customize the following parameters:  
- Max fee: The maximum total fee for the transaction.  
- Max priority fee: The maximum additional fee per gas unit paid to miners/validators to prioritize your transaction.  
- Gas limit  

### Legacy model

All EVM chains support the Legacy model.

In the Legacy model, the estimated transaction fee is calculated as: gas price * gas limit

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                                                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gas price  | The gas price in gwei, representing the amount of ETH paid to validators per gas unit to process the transaction.                    |
| Gas limit  | The maximum number of gas units you are willing to spend to execute the transaction or run the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Different operations consume different amounts of gas units. |

<Note>For both Legacy and EIP-1559 fee models, an additional fee is charged when submitting transaction calldata to L1 (Layer 1).</Note>

You can customize the following parameters:  
- Gas price  
- Gas limit  

## UTXO-based chains

Currently supported chains include:  
- Bitcoin  
- Cardano  
- Nervos CKB  
- Handshake  

On UTXO-based chains, the estimated transaction fee is calculated as: fee rate * transaction size

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fee rate         | The fee per byte of data, indicating how many satoshis are paid per vByte (abbreviated as sats/vByte). |
| Transaction size | The on-chain space occupied by the transaction, which affects the total fee in UTXO models.        |

You can customize the following parameters:  
- Fee rate  

## Solana

On Solana, you can use the native model or choose the Legacy model. In the native model, the estimated transaction fee is calculated as: base fee + (CU price * CU limit)

| Parameter | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| base fee  | A fixed fee charged per signature (by default, 5,000 Lamports per signature).                       |
| CU price  | The price per Compute Unit (CU), used to increase transaction priority. Denominated in Lamports.    |
| CU limit  | The maximum number of CUs the transaction is allowed to consume. A higher value increases priority but also increases cost. |

You can customize the following parameters:  
- CU price  
- CU limit  

## Filecoin

On Filecoin, you can use the native model or choose the Legacy model. In the native model, the estimated transaction fee is calculated as: min(gas fee cap, base fee + gas premium) * gas limit

| Parameter     | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Gas fee cap   | The maximum price you are willing to pay per unit of gas.                                         |
| Base fee      | The minimum fee required for block inclusion, which adjusts dynamically with network congestion and is burned after payment, thereby reducing the total FIL supply. |
| Gas premium   | A user-specified miner tip to increase transaction priority.                                      |
| Gas limit     | The maximum amount of gas the transaction is allowed to consume.                                  |

You can customize the following parameters:  
- Gas fee cap  
- Gas premium  
- Gas limit  

## Chains using the fixed model

The following chains adopt a fixed fee model:  
- TRON  
- Algorand  
- Polkadot  
- Internet Computer and its ICRC assets (ckBTC, ckETH, ckUSDC, ckUSDT, DKP, GLDGOV, ICS, NICP, OC, OGY)  
- Stellar  
- Ripple  
- Tezos  
- Sui  
- Near  

The fixed fee model charges a fixed fee for each transaction.
