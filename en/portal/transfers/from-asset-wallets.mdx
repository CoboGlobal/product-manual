## Prerequisite

- It's recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).
- You have [deposited](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/asset-wallets/transfers) funds into the Asset Wallets.

## Steps

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).

2. To open the **Transfer** dialog, click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon" alt="The transfer button" /> in the main menu of Cobo Portal. Alternatively, click <img src="/en/images/custodial-wallet/withdraw-icon.png" className="icon"/> on your Asset Wallet page, the corresponding token or address will be preselected for you.

3. Select **Custodial Wallets > Asset Wallets** as the source wallet. The transfer amount and gas fee will be deducted from this wallet. For the wallet address, select from the drop-down menu or search by wallet name, address, or label. Asset Wallets created via both Cobo Portal and WaaS 2.0 API will be listed.

4. Select the token type and network for the transfer. To enable a new token type, navigate to your Asset Wallet page and click **Add Tokens**.

5. Select a recipient address from your Address Book or your wallets on Cobo Portal, or manually enter an address.
    
    - **Address Book**<img src="/en/images/common/icon_address_book.svg" className="icon" alt="Address Book icon" />: Only addresses associated with the blockchain network of the selected token will be listed.
    - **My Wallets**: Select a wallet type and then click on the specific wallet you would like to transfer to.

    If this transfer can be executed as a [Cobo Loop](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/asset-wallets/cobo-loop) transfer, a related information bar will appear on the UI as the following screenshot shows.
    <img src="/en/images/transfers/loop_info_bar.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Screenshot of the information bar" />

    <Info>If you are using the WaaS 2.0 API, you can use the [Check Cobo Loop transfers](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/check-loop-transfers) operation to determine if a transaction can be executed as a Cobo Loop transfer. Or directly call the [Transfer token](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/transfer-token) operation to enforce a transaction as a Cobo Loop transfer.</Info>

6. Enter the transfer amount.
7. Review the transaction cost. You are unable to modify or customize this fee. 

    Transaction fees consist of the following three aspects:
        - Sweeping gas fee: When you deposit a non-native token (e.g., USDT on Ethereum), Cobo pre-charges your deposit address with the native token (e.g., ETH) as gas to ensure future withdrawals can be processed smoothly. This fee is calculated as: Sweeping fee of current token balance × (Withdrawal amount / Current token balance)%, based on the real-time on-chain gas price.
        - Compliance fee: Covers KYT/AML service fees for deposits and withdrawals, as well as Cobo’s compliance investigation costs. This fee is calculated as: Deposit compliance fee of current token balance × (Withdrawal amount / Current token balance)% + Withdrawal compliance fee.
        - Withdrawal gas fee: Calculated based on the real-time on-chain gas price.

The fee amount will be deducted from the source wallet that you selected in step 3. Please ensure that the source wallet has the required token enabled and sufficient balance for the fee payment.

9. Click **Submit**.
10. Approve the request on your Cobo Guard. If it is a new address not found in your Address Book or any of your wallets created on Cobo Portal, you will be prompted to add the address to your Address Book.

## Next steps

After making a transfer from your Asset Wallets, you can view its transaction status in **Transaction History**. The flash icon <img src="/en/images/custodial-wallet/icon_loop.png" className="icon" alt="The flash icon" /> indicates it was executed as a Cobo Loop transfer as the following screenshot shows.
<img src="/en/images/transfers/loop_history.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Screenshot of the transaction history" />

If you are using the WaaS 2.0 API, you can call the [Get transaction information](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/get-transaction-information) or [List all transactions operations](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/transactions/list-all-transactions) and check the `is_loop` property in the response. 
Additionally, you can use the [Cobo Loop Explorer](https://loop.top/) along with the Loop ID (the transaction hash of the transfer) to track the status of Cobo Loop transfers.
