This article explains how to withdraw assets from an Exchange Wallet. In this context, a withdrawal refers to transferring assets from an Exchange Wallet to another wallet created on the Cobo Portal or an external address. 

Only Exchange Wallets (Main Account) with a trading account type of Spot or Fund support withdrawals. To withdraw assets from an Exchange Wallet (Sub Account), you must first transfer the assets from the Sub Account to the associated Main Account, and then withdraw from the Main Account. To learn more about transfers between the Sub Accounts and associated Main Accounts and transfers between trading accounts, see [Transfer Within an Exchange Wallet](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/within-wallet).

For the list of exchanges supported by Cobo Portal, refer to [Supported exchanges](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/supported-exchanges).

## Prerequisites

- You have successfully linked an exchange account to your Exchange Wallet.
- It is highly recommended that you set up an [off-chain transaction policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview) for your Exchange Wallet.
- Your Exchange Wallet has sufficient balance.
- You have enough native token in your wallet to pay for the gas fee (on-chain transaction fee), or you have enabled [Fee Station](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction) to pay for the gas fee.
