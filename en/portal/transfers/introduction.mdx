The Transfer module is meticulously designed to streamline the movement of assets within, into, and out of the four wallet types available on Cobo Portal. These encompass Custodial Wallets, MPC Wallets, Smart Contract Wallets, and Exchange Wallets. Currently, Cobo Portal supports the following transfer scenarios:


1. Transfers from Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets), MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets), Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;), or Exchange Wallets to external addresses.
2. Transfers between Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets), MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets), Smart Contract Wallets (Safe&#123;Wallet&#125;), and Exchange Wallets.
3. Transfers between Main Accounts and Sub Accounts within the same exchange.

To make a transfer, log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login) and then click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon"></img> in the main menu on the left hand side.

For transfers from MPC Wallets and Custodial Wallets (Asset Wallets), you can use [Fee Station](/en/portal/fee-station/introduction) to pay for the gas fee.

<Info>**Memo/Tag (Optional)**: The field is only visible when you select a token that requires it. For transfers out of Cobo Portal, it is highly recommended to include a memo/tag for the following chains: XRP, EOS, XLM, IOST, BNB_BNB, ATOM, LUNA, and TON.</Info>
