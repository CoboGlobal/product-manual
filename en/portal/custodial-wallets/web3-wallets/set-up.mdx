Web3 Wallets are a type of Custodial Wallets that allow token transfers, contract calls, and message signing. You can create multiple wallets to suit your business needs.

## Prerequisites

- Set up your account and complete other required steps following the [Quick start guide](/en/portal/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets).
- You have been assigned the [Operator](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role or a role with equivelant permissions.
- Contact Cobo's customer support at [help@cobo.com](mailto:help@cobo.com) to enable Web3 Wallets. If you do not request activation, the **Web3 Wallets** tab will not appear on the **Custodial Wallets** page. Once enabled, a wallet named **Default Web3 Wallet** will be automatically created, and a wallet address will be generated for each activated chain.

## Steps

1. Log into [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
