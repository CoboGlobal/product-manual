This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for setting up and using MPC Wallets on Cobo Portal. You'll learn how to:

1. Set up your account and organization
2. Create vaults and wallets
3. Make deposits and withdrawals

<Note>Cobo Portal offers two types of MPC Wallets: [Organization-Controlled Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/introduction) and [User-Controlled Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ucw/introduction). This guide will focus on Organization-Controlled Wallets.</Note>

## Set up an MPC vault

After setting up your account and organization, the next step is to configure an MPC vault. A default vault is automatically created for you. You need to complete the setup by creating a Main Key through generating key shares.

<Note>To learn about vaults, key shares, and other related concepts, see [Introduction to Organization-Controlled Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/introduction).</Note>

### Create a Main Key

A set of private key shares form a [private key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview). The Main Key is the first private key you create before using MPC Wallets.

The diagram below illustrates a Main Key with two key share holders. Cobo holds one key share, while your organization holds the other.

<img src="/en/images/get-started/key-shares.svg" className="diagram" alt="Key Shares"/>

Follow the instructions below to create a Main Key in Cobo Portal:
1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
      * For testing purposes, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
      * For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Click **Create Main Key**.
4. In the **Create Main Key** dialog box, configure **Key Share Holder 2**. For detailed information about signer types and their setup, see [Signer Type](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group#signer-type).

    - To use a mobile signer, select a holder from the pull-down list. The **TSS Node ID** field will be filled in automatically. Click **Confirm**. <Note>For quick testing, you can select yourself as a holder. However, for production use, refer to our [Security best practices](/en/portal/security-checklist#key-share-holder-groups) for guidance on selecting appropriate holders.</Note>

    - To use a server signer, enter a holder name, fill in the TSS Node ID, and then click **Confirm**.


5. Confirm in your Cobo Guard app that you initiated this request.

### Generate key shares

To finalize the vault setup, the next crucial step is generating key shares on your signer. This process varies depending on your signer type:

* For mobile signers:
  - Wait for the **1 key share needs to be generated** banner to appear on Cobo Guard (this may take a few seconds).
  - Tap the banner to open the key generation interface.
  - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the key share generation process.
  - We recommend backing up your key shares at this point for added security. However, you can also choose to complete this step later after finishing the guide.

* For server signers:
  * Ensure the TSS Node server is brought online within 24 hours. The key share generation process initiates automatically when the server comes online.
  * If a [TSS Node callback server](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/callback-server-overview) is configured, the generation process will only start after approval from the callback server.

Once the key generation process is completed, the status of the corresponding key share holder will become **Active** on the **Key Share Management** page on Cobo Portal. You might need to refresh the page to see the updated result.

## Create a wallet and transfer tokens
### Create a wallet

After successful key generation, a default wallet is automatically created for your vault. You can create additional wallets by following the steps below:

1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
      * For testing purposes, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
      * For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Click **Create Wallet**. In the dialog box:
   - Enter a unique name for your wallet.
   - If you need to automatically consolidate funds from multiple addresses, enable [auto token sweeping](/en/portal/auto-sweep-overview). If you're unsure, you can leave it disabled for now and enable it later if needed.
4. Click **Create**.
5. From the wallet list, select your newly created wallet to view its details.


### Make a deposit

To make a deposit, you should first generate a deposit address for your wallet:

1. Navigate to the **Addresses** tab, and then click **Add Address**.
2. Select a network, and then click **Create**.
3. Navigate to the address you just created and click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/icon_deposit.svg" className="icon"></img> to display the address.
   <img src="/en/images/get-started/deposit.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Add Tokens"/>
4. Proceed to your preferred external wallet to initiate the transfer to the deposit address.

### Configure transaction policies
<Note>If you're in the testing phase and want to quickly verify deposits and withdrawals first, you can skip this section for now and set them up later.</Note>

<Accordion title="Configure transaction policies">

[Transaction policies](/en/portal/risk-controls/tx-policies-overview) are essential measures to secure your digital asset operations. When a transaction starts, it's checked against your organization's transaction policies in sequential order. If it matches a policy's trigger condition, the specified action will be taken: auto-approve, auto-reject, or an approval quorum process.

In this guide, we'll create a policy that requires 2-of-3 Admin approval for large USDT withdrawals to non-trusted addresses. For other policy setups and advanced configurations, see [Set up token transfer policy](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).

#### Prerequisites

You have at least three members with the [Admin role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) in your organization.

#### Configure an address list
First, set up a list of trusted addresses for withdrawals:

1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
    - For testing, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com).
    - For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com).

2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies**.
3. Navigate to the **Address Lists** tab and click **Create List**.
<img src="/en/images/risk-controls/create-an-address-list.png" className="screenshot_full_screen"/>
4. Enter a name for your address list, then click **Confirm**.
5. Click your newly created address list, click **Add Address**, then enter your trusted addresses.
6. Click **Submit** and complete MFA.

For more details on managing address lists, including batch uploads, see [Address list](/en/portal/risk-controls/address-list).

#### Create the transaction policy

Now, let's create a policy with the following security rules:
- Trigger: Withdrawals over 30,000,000 USDT to non-trusted addresses
- Action: Require approval from 2 out of 3 approvers with the Admin user role.

Follow these steps:

1. In Cobo Portal, go to <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"/> > **Transaction Policies**.
2. Click **Create Policy** > **Token Transfer**.
3. Configure the settings as shown in the screenshot:

<img src="/en/images/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets/example-policy.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Policy Created"/>

4. Click **Next** and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the policy setup.

Your policy is now active and will require 2-of-3 approval for any USDT withdrawal over 30,000,000 to non-trusted addresses.
</Accordion>


### Make a withdrawal

Follow the steps below to withdraw tokens from your wallet. 

<Info>To learn more about withdrawal, such as transaction fees, risk control measures, and signing procedures, see [Transfer from MPC Wallets (Organization-Controlled Wallets)](/en/portal/transfers/from-mpc-wallets).</Info>

1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
      * For testing purposes, use the [development environment](https://portal.dev.cobo.com/login).
      * For production, use the [production environment](https://portal.cobo.com/login).

2. Click <img src="/en/images/transfers/transfer-button.svg" className="icon"></img> in the main menu on the left hand side.
<img src="/en/images/get-started/withdraw.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
3. In the **Transfer** dialog box, fill in the required information, and then click **Submit**.
4. Double confirm the withdrawal on Cobo Guard.
5. After the withdrawal is confirmed, the transaction will be sent to signes. The transaction will remain pending until it receives the necessary signature. 

      - For **mobile signers**, notify them to open their Cobo Guard to sign the transaction.
      
      - For **server signers**, you can check if they are online through Cobo Portal:
            1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
            2. Click <img src="/en/images/transfers/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
            3. Select your vault and then click the **Manage Share Management** icon <img src="/en/images/transfers/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
            4. In the **Key Share Management** page, check if there is a green dot on the avatar of the server signer:
                  - 🟢 Green dot: The server is online and ready to sign transactions
                  - No dot: The server is offline and cannot sign transactions.

      <img src="/en/images/transfers/main-group-active.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Key Share Management page showing server signer status"/>
      
      After the transaction is signed, Cobo creates and broadcasts it to the network. The token transfer may take some time to complete, depending on network conditions.

### View transaction details and status
After making a transfer to or from your Asset Wallets, you can view its transaction status in <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **Transaction History**.
