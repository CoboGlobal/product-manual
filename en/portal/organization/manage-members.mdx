To manage organization members, go to bottom-left user profile > **Organization** > **Members** page.

<img src="/en/images/organization/entry.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="organization member management" />

On this page, you can add, edit, freeze, or remove members with options in the **Actions** column, depending on your team’s operational and management needs.

### Add new members to the organization

To invite new members to your organization and assign them a [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) (such as Viewer or Spender), use the **Invite member** option.

- The invited member will receive an email and must complete account setup before joining the organization.
- If your organization has enabled relevant [governance policies](/en/portal/organization/governance-intro), the invitation will require approval.
- To re-invite a previously deleted member, refer to the [Cobo Accounts FAQ](/en/accounts/troubleshoot).

For members who have not yet accepted an invitation, you can:

- <img src="/en/images/organization/icon_resend email.svg" className="icon" /> **Resend email**: Remind the member to complete registration.  
- <img src="/en/images/organization/icon_cancel.svg" className="icon" /> **Cancel invitation**: Withdraw the invitation if the information was incorrect or no longer needed.

### Manage existing members

For members who have already joined, you can perform the following actions:

- <img src="/en/images/organization/icon_edit.svg" className="icon" /> **Modify user role**: Adjust a member’s user role, for example, changing from Viewer to Admin.  
- <img src="/en/images/organization/icon_freeze.svg" className="icon" /> **Freeze member**: Temporarily restrict access to organization resources. Frozen members cannot log into the organization.  
- <img src="/en/images/organization/icon_unfreeze.svg" className="icon" /> **Unfreeze member**: Restore access for previously frozen members.  
- <img src="/en/images/organization/icon_delete.svg" className="icon" /> **Delete member**: Permanently revoke access. This is recommended when a member leaves the organization or no longer requires access.

You can filter members by name, role, status, or recent activity time to quickly locate and manage specific members.
