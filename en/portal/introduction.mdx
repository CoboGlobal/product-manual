## Key features

### An all-in-one wallet platform

Cobo Portal combines all four wallet technologies in one platform with state-of-the-art security architecture and the industry’s widest coverage of chains and tokens ([click here](/en/portal/supported-tokens) for supported chains and tokens).

- [Custodial Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/introduction): Custodial Wallets utilize advanced encryption techniques and risk control engines to ensure that your funds are protected against unauthorized access and potential attacks. It implements a robust 3-tier (hot-warm-cold) private key storage architecture with 95% of funds securely stored in cold wallets and only 5% in hot and warm wallets.
- [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction): Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is an advanced cryptographic technology utilized for key management on the blockchain. Cobo Portal offers two types of MPC Wallets: Organization-Controlled Wallets, providing organizations with complete control of their own funds or their end users’ assets, and User-Controlled Wallets, giving end users full control of their digital assets.
- [Smart Contract Wallets](/en/portal/smart-contract-wallets/introduction): This wallet type supports a myriad of smart contract wallets, prominently featuring Safe\{Wallet\} alongside other account abstraction wallets. It also allows the flexibility to delegate an Externally Owned Accounts (EOA) wallet to interact seamlessly with the smart contract ecosystem.
- [Exchange Wallets](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/introduction): Exchange Wallets are your one-stop solution for managing multiple exchange accounts effortlessly. It brings all of your exchange accounts together in a single, user-friendly interface, providing a seamless experience for viewing, monitoring, and managing your assets across various exchanges.
