## What are User-Controlled Wallets

User-Controlled Wallets are a subtype of [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction). In a User-Controlled Wallet, end users of your [organization](/en/portal/organization/introduction) are given full control of their digital assets. In this setup, each end user of your organization holds their own unique private key share to their MPC Wallets.

With a flexible [Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction#threshold-signature-scheme-tss) (”m out of n” key shares), User-Controlled Wallets allow your organization to customize how transactions are signed. For example, under a 3-3 signature scheme, your organization, your end user, and Cobo each hold a key share, and all three key shares must collectively sign transactions. Alternatively, a 2-3 signature scheme can be implemented, where your organization’s key share is held offline and utilized only in specific circumstances, such as disputes or critical events.

To integrate non-custodial MPC Wallets into your applications, a 2-2 signature can be implemented, where your end user and Cobo each hold a key share, while your organization holds none.

## Object Model

### Project

A project is a collection of vaults.

### Vault

A vault is a collection of User-Controlled Wallets sharing the same root extended private key.

### Root Extended Private Key

Each vault is associated with a unique root extended private key. This master private key is used within the MPC framework to generate a series of key shares. Each set of key shares is referred to as a [private key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview).

You can set up multiple projects, vaults, and wallets to meet the specific requirements of your business.
