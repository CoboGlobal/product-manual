## Overview

You can create different projects to suit your business needs. For instance, you might set up Project A using the 3-3 [Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction#threshold-signature-scheme-tss), where your organization, your end user, and Cobo each hold a private key share. Meanwhile, Project B could utilize the 2-2 signature scheme, with both your end user and Cobo holding a private key share.

<Info>A project is a collection of vaults, and a vault is a collection of wallets. See [Object model](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ucw/object-model).</Info>

<Info>Only the organization [admin](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a project.</Info>


## Create a project

You can use either [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login) or the [WaaS 2.0 API](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/overview/introduction) to create a project. This section describes how to create a project using Cobo Portal. If you want to create a project using the WaaS 2.0 API, see **Complete the Initial setup** > **Create projects with the Client Backend or Cobo Portal** on [Get started with MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets)](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw#1-complete-the-initial-setup).

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets** > **User-Controlled Wallets** > **Create Project**.
3. Enter a **Project Name** and select a **Threshold of Signing Key** (i.e. the Threshold Signature Scheme), then click **Create**.
4. Enter your 6-digit Google Authenticator code.
5. Your project has now been created.

After creating a project, you can create vaults within it. Refer to **Complete the Initial setup** > **Create a vault** on [Get started with MPC Wallets (User-Controlled Wallets)](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/get-started-ucw#1-complete-the-initial-setup) for more details.

## Manage a project

Follow these instructions to manage a specific project.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/wallets_icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets** > **User-Controlled Wallets**, then click a project to open its own management page.

On the project's management page, you can manage both the project and the vaults in it.

You can click **View Transaction History** <img src="/en/images/common/icon_view transactions.svg" className="icon"></img> and **Edit Project Name** <img src="/en/images/common/icon_edit.svg" className="icon"></img> to manage the project accordingly.
