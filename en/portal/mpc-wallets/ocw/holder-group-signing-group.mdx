## Signing Key
Signing Keys are created using the Main Key. You can create multiple Signing Keys for different members depending on your business needs.

### Create a Signing Key
Similar to creating the Main Key, you have the option to choose either mobile signer or server signer when creating the Signing Key. Make sure you understand the primary purposes and prerequisites of each signer type by referring to the table in [Create a Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group#signer-type) before proceeding further.

After you've chosen a signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Signing Key. **Note:** Only the users who have been assigned [the Operator user role in the organization](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) can create a Signing Key.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. In the **Key Group Management** page, click **Create Signing Key**.

5. The Signing Key creation process is the same as the Main Key creation process. See [Create Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group) for detailed instructions.

### Manage Signing Key
#### Upgrade Signing Key to Main Key
In certain situations, you may want to upgrade a Signing Key to the Main Key. For example, if the current key share holder of the Main Key is leaving the organization and you need to assign a key share holder of the Main Key, you may choose to upgrade a specific Signing Key to the new Main Key.

Follow the instructions below to upgrade a Signing Key to a Main Key.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/wallets-icon.svg" className="icon"></img> > **MPC Wallets**.
3. Select your vault and then click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/manage-key-share-group.svg" className="icon"></img> on the upper right hand corner.
4. On the **Key Group Management** page, locate the key share holder of the Signing Key you want to upgrade. In the same row, click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_more.svg" className="icon" alt="the overflow icon showing more options"/> under the **Action** column.
5. Click **Upgrade to Main Key**.

6. Click **Confirm** to upgrade the Signing Key to the Main Key.
