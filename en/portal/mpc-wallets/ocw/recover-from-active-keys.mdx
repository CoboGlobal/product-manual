**Note**: If the locally stored private key share is lost and the backed-up data file is no longer accessible, the key share holder can recover their private key share with the assistance of another active private key. Unlike restoration, recovery relies on the support from another private key.

## If Main Key is lost or compromised

There are two options for recovering your key shares in this scenario:

- Upgrade an active Sigining Key to function as the Main Key. The original Main Key will be automatically deleted. For more information, please refer to [Manage Sigining Keys](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups#manage-signing-groups).
- Use an active Recovery Key to reshare a new Main Key. The original Main Key will be automatically deleted. For more information, please refer to [Manage Recovery Keys](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups#manage-recovery-groups).

## If Sigining Key is lost or compromised

Use the active Main Key to generate a new Sigining Key. For more information, please refer to [Manage Sigining Keys](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups#manage-signing-groups).

## If Recovery Key is lost or compromised

Use the active Main Key to generate a new Recovery Key. For more information, please refer to [Manage Recovery Keys](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups#manage-recovery-groups).
