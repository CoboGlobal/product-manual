#### Vault
A vault is a collection of Organization-Controlled Wallets sharing the same root extended private key.

#### Root Extended Private Key
Each vault is associated with a unique root extended private key. This master private key is used within the MPC framework to generate a series of key shares. Each set of key shares is referred to as a [private key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview).

You can set up multiple vaults, and create various wallets within each vault to meet the specific requirements of your business.
