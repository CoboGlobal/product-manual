## Applicable scenarios  

When a team member who holds key shares (Main Group, Signing Group, or Recovery Group) leaves or transfers, their key shares need to be handed over to other team members. Failure to complete the handover may lead to the following issues:  
- Transaction signing may fail due to insufficient valid shares, making funds in the Vault temporarily inaccessible. 
- The original holder retains Main Group, Signing Group, or Recovery Group permissions, posing security risks.  

<Note>This scenario covers key share handover between team members. For information on Cobo Guard device replacement or loss, please refer to [Reset Cobo Guard after device change or reinstallation](/en/guard/reset).</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Each key share is bound to the holder's Cobo Accounts and cannot be directly transferred. Handover requires creating new key shares. New key shares must be generated for the new holder, with corresponding organizational structure adjustments.  
- Delete the old holder's key shares only after confirming the new holder's key shares are available, to avoid Vault funds being inaccessible during the handover process.
- If you encounter any issues during the handover, please contact the [Cobo Support Team](mailto:help@cobo.com) promptly. 

## Procedures  

### Main Group handover  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate new key share">
    Original Main Group creates a Signing Group for the new holder. See [Create a Signing Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group#create-a-signing-group).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify new key share">
    (Optional) Confirm the new Signing Group is available with key share verification. See [Verify key shares](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/key-share-verification).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upgrade to Main Group">
    Upgrade the Signing Group to a Main Group. The original Main Group will be automatically deleted after the upgrade. See [Convert Signing Group into Main Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group#convert-signing-group-into-main-group).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Signing Group/Recovery Group handover
