## Applicable scenarios  

When a team member who holds key shares (Main Key, Signing Key, or Recovery Key) leaves or transfers, their key shares need to be handed over to other team members. Failure to complete the handover may lead to the following issues:  
- Transaction signing may fail due to insufficient valid shares, making funds in the Vault temporarily inaccessible. 
- The original holder retains Main Key, Signing Key, or Recovery Key permissions, posing security risks.  

<Note>This scenario covers key share handover between team members. For information on Cobo Guard device replacement or loss, please refer to [Reset Cobo Guard after device change or reinstallation](/en/guard/reset).</Note>

## Prerequisites

- Each key share is bound to the holder's Cobo Accounts and cannot be directly transferred. Handover requires creating new key shares. New key shares must be generated for the new holder, with corresponding organizational structure adjustments.  
- Delete the old holder's key shares only after confirming the new holder's key shares are available, to avoid Vault funds being inaccessible during the handover process.
- If you encounter any issues during the handover, please contact the [Cobo Support Team](mailto:help@cobo.com) promptly. 

## Procedures  

### Main Key handover  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate new key share">
    Original Main Key creates a Signing Key for the new holder. See [Create a Signing Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group#create-a-signing-group).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify new key share">
    (Optional) Confirm the new Signing Key is available with key share verification. See [Verify key shares](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/key-share-verification).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upgrade to Main Key">
    Upgrade the Signing Key to a Main Key. The original Main Key will be automatically deleted after the upgrade. See [Convert Signing Key into Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group#convert-signing-group-into-main-group).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Signing Key/Recovery Key handover  

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate new key share">
    The Main Key creates a Signing Key or Recovery Key for the new holder. See [Create a Signing Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-signing-group#create-a-signing-group) or [Create a Recovery Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-recovery-group#create-a-recovery-group).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify new key share">
