## What are private keys?

With MPC technology, private key shares are individually generated within separate secure environments, encrypted, and divided amongst multiple parties. A set of key shares jointly form a private key.

There are three types of private keys: Main Key, Signing Key, and Recovery Key. The Main Key is the first set of key shares you create before using MPC Wallets. It will be used to create both Signing Keys and Recovery Keys.

<Note>To ensure the safety and recoverability of your assets, it is recommended to create at least one Signing Key and one Recovery Key in addition to the Main Key.</Note>
