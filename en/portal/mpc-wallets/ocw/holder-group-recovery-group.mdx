## Recovery Key
Recovery Keys serve two main purposes: Recover the whole private key and create a new Main Key if your Main Key and backup copy are lost or compromised. To learn more about backup and recovery, see [Back up key shareas](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/back-up-key-share-groups) and [Recover key shares](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/restore-from-backup).

Similar to creating the Main Key and Signing Key, you have the option to choose either mobile signer or server signer when creating the Recovery Key. Make sure you understand [the primary purposes and prerequisites of each signer type](#signer-type) before proceeding further.

After you've chosen a signer type and set up the prerequisites, follow the instructions below to create a Recovery Key. 

<Note>Only the users who have been assigned the Operator, Manager, Admin [user roles]((/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions)) in the organization can create a Recovery Key.</Note>
