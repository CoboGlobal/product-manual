After youâ€™ve created one or many of the [3 types of private keys](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-overview), it is a good idea to have key share holders back up their keys. Key share holders back up their key shares differently depending on whether the key shares were generated using a mobile signer or a server signer.

## Mobile signer
Key share holders can use the Cobo Guard app they used to confirm the key creation process to back up any key shares created on their Cobo Guard. See [Generate and back up your key shares](/en/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares).

## Server signer
Key share holders can back up their key shares using the server signer. For details, see [Back up your key share](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/guides/mpc-wallets/server-co-signer/key-shares-backup).
