## Prerequisites

You have been assigned the [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) of Operator, Manager, or Admin.

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/switch.svg" className="icon"></img> next to your default vault.

3. In the pop-up dialog, click **Return to Vault List**.

4. Click **Create Vault** in the upper right corner.

5. Enter a name for your new vault. You can also set the vault as the default vault.

6. Click **Create**.

Now you have created a new vault.

## Next steps

After creating a vault, you can:
- Set default vault.
- Modify the name of your vault.
- Export details such as the list of addresses under your vault and their corresponding balances. The button will be visible only after the successful creation of the [Main Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups).
- View all transactions associated with your vault. The button will be visible only after the successful creation of the [Main Group](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups).
- View root extended public keys associated with each vault. Manage the Main Group, Signing Groups, and Recovery Groups. For more information, see [Manage holder groups](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups).
- Search for a wallet in the vault by wallet name.
- Sort the wallets in the vault by created time.
- Switch the vault display between grid view and list view.
