## Prerequisites

You have been assigned the [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) of Operator, Manager, or Admin.

## Steps

A vault is a collection of wallets sharing the same root extended private key. A default vault will be created for you automatically. You need to [create your Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group) to complete the setup.

If you need to create additional vaults, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login).
2. Click <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/switch.svg" className="icon"></img> next to your default vault.

3. In the pop-up dialog, click **Return to Vault List**.

4. Click **Create Vault** in the upper right corner.

5. Enter a name for your new vault. You can also set the vault as the default vault.

6. Click **Create**.

Now you have created a new vault. You need to [create your Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/holder-group-main-group) to complete the setup.

## Next steps

After creating a vault, you can:
- Set it as the default vault.
- Modify the name of your vault.
- Export details such as the list of addresses under your vault and their corresponding balances. The button will be visible only after the successful creation of the [Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups).
- View all transactions associated with your vault. The button will be visible only after the successful creation of the [Main Key](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups).
- View root extended public keys associated with each vault. Manage the Main Key, Signing Keys, and Recovery Keys. For more information, see [Manage private keys](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/manage-key-share-groups).
- Search for a wallet in the vault by wallet name.
- Sort the wallets in the vault by created time.
- Switch the vault display between grid view and list view.
