## View root extended public keys
Depending on the number of cryptographic algorithms supported on Cobo Portal, a set of root extended public keys associated with your vault will be displayed. Note that all public keys for MPC Wallets in this vault are derived from these root extended public keys.

## Manage Holder Groups

<Note>Prerequisite: To manage key share groups, you need to have the [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) of Operator, Manager, or Admin.</Note>

### Manage Main Group

Under the **Main Group** tab, you can view information such as its creation time, key share holders, their TSS Node IDs, group status, and Group IDs.

### Manage Signing Groups
Under the **Signing Group** tab, you can view or delete existing Signing Groups, create new Signing Groups, or upgrade a Signing Group to function as the Main Group.
Notes:
- Upon deletion, the key share holders in the designated Signing Group will no longer receive any signature requests. In the event that key holders associated with the deleted Signing Group require reinstatement for receiving signature requests, they must undergo a new key generation process.
- Upon upgrading, the designated Signing Group will assume the responsibilities of the original Main Group, such as aiding in the creation of new Signing Groups and Recovery Groups. The original Main Group will be automatically deleted.

### Manage Recovery Groups
Under the **Recovery Group** tab, you can:
- View existing Recovery Groups
- Delete existing Recovery Groups

    <Info>Upon deletion, the key share holders in the designated Recovery Group can no longer be used to recover a new Main Group. In the event that key holders associated with the deleted Recovery Group require reinstatement, they must undergo a new key generation process.</Info>

- Create new Recovery Groups

- Use a Recovery Group to recover a new Main Group

    <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/recover-new-main-group-config.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
    <Info>Upon recovering, the original Main Group will be automatically deleted and replaced by the new Main Group. This new Main Group can then be used to facilitate the creation of new Signing Groups and Recovery Groups.</Info>

## Common management scenarios

### Holder group changes
If your holder group requires adding, removing, or replacing members, please refer to [Key Share Transfer](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/key-share-transfer) for detailed steps.

### Cobo Guard device issues
If a holder's Cobo Guard device is lost or changed, or the Cobo Guard app is reinstalled, please refer to [Reset Cobo Guard after device change or reinstallation](/en/guard/reset) for detailed steps.
