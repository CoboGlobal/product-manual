## View root extended public keys
Depending on the number of cryptographic algorithms supported on Cobo Portal, a set of root extended public keys associated with your vault will be displayed. Note that all public keys for MPC Wallets in this vault are derived from these root extended public keys.

## Manage private keys

<Note>Prerequisite: To manage keys, you need to have the [user role](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) of Operator, Manager, or Admin.</Note>

### Manage Main Key

On the **Key Share Management** page, locate the key share holder with the **Main Key** label. You can view information such as their TSS Node ID, creation time, status, and key ID.

### Manage Signing Keys

On the **Key Share Management** page, you can view or delete existing Signing Keys, create new Signing Keys, or upgrade a Signing Key to function as the Main Key.

Notes:
- Upon deletion, the key share holders in the designated Signing Key will no longer receive any signature requests. In the event that key holders associated with the deleted Signing Key require reinstatement for receiving signature requests, they must undergo a new key generation process.
- Upon upgrading, the designated Signing Key will assume the responsibilities of the original Main Key, such as aiding in the creation of new Signing Keys and Recovery Keys. The original Main Key will be automatically deleted.

### Manage Recovery Keys

On the **Key Share Management** page, click **Recovery Keys** to:
- View existing Recovery Keys
- Delete existing Recovery Keys

    <Info>Upon deletion, the key share holders in the designated Recovery Key can no longer be used to recover a new Main Key. In the event that key holders associated with the deleted Recovery Key require reinstatement, they must undergo a new key generation process.</Info>

- Create new Recovery Keys
    <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/create-new-recovery-group.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>

- Use a Recovery Key to recover a new Main Key

    <img src="/en/images/mpc-wallet/recover-new-main-group-config.png" className="screenshot_modal"/>
    <Info>Upon recovering, the original Main Key will be automatically deleted and replaced by the new Main Key. This new Main Key can then be used to facilitate the creation of new Signing Keys and Recovery Keys.</Info>

## Common management scenarios

### Key share holder changes
For replacing key share holders, see [Key share handover](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/key-share-transfer) for detailed steps.

### Cobo Guard device issues
If a holder's Cobo Guard device is lost or changed, or the Cobo Guard app is reinstalled, see [Reset Cobo Guard after device change or reinstallation](/en/guard/reset) for detailed steps.
