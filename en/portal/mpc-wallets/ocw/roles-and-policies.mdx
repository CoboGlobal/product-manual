## Configure user roles and permissions

Cobo Portal offers extensive role-based access control capabilities for you to segregate duties and safeguard your assets and operations.

By assigning roles to your team members, they will be granted permissions associated with that role, governing which parts of the platform they can access and what operations they can perform. Cobo Portal offers preset user roles, such as Admin, Approver, Spender, and Viewer. Alternatively, you can also customize your own roles to suit your unique business needs.

To view preset roles and/or create customized roles, click **Organization** > **User Roles**.

## Configure off-chain transaction policies

You can effortlessly set up and edit off-chain transaction policies. Note that off-chain transaction policies are managed by the backend system of Cobo Portal. You can also automate how each transaction will be handled by setting up an approval action. This could include auto approval, auto rejection, approval quorum, and customized workflows.

Each organization manages a list of off-chain transaction policies. When a transaction is initiated, it undergoes a matching process against the ordered policies in the list. If a matching policy is identified, the corresponding approval action will be automatically executed.


To learn how to configure off-chain transaction policies, see [**Off-chain transaction policies**](/en/portal/risk-controls/off-chain-tx-set-transfer).
