If you are switching to a new iOS device, have lost access to your old device, or have reinstalled Cobo Guard, you will need to reset Cobo Guard on your new device to continue using it normally.

<Note>To avoid potential risks, we do not recommend uninstalling and reinstalling Cobo Guard on your device. If you mistakenly do so, you must also reset Cobo Guard. In this scenario, both “old device” and “new device” in this documentation refer to the same device.</Note>

Choose the relevant section to read depending on whether you have created a key share:
- [For Cobo Guard users who are key share holders](#key-share-holders)
- [For Cobo Guard users who haven't created key shares](#non-key-share-holders)

### Reset decision guide for key share holders

If your Cobo Guard serves as a key share holder and participates in MPC Wallet key management, please refer to the decision diagram below before resetting.

<Info>Note: This diagram does not represent the actual UI flow. The UI will guide you based on the device and backup information you select, and show only the steps that apply to your situation (see the next section **Steps to reset Cobo Guard for key share holders**). However, it may not cover certain edge cases. This diagram provides a complete overview of all possible key share recovery paths for your reference.</Info>

#### Scenario 1: Old device available <a id="scenario1"></a>

If Cobo Guard is still available on your old device, you will be prompted to complete the following items.

For step 1 (backing up your key share or checking your backup file), see [Back up your key shares](/en/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares#back-up-your-key-shares).

For step 3 (restoring your key share), below are detailed instructions:

1. Open Cobo Guard on your new device and select **Restore existing key shares first**. Cobo Guard will begin checking your key share files.

2. Select the TSS Node IDs associated with the key shares you wish to restore, then tap **Restore**.

    <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/restore3.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Screenshot of entering the passphrase" />

4. Once restored, Cobo Guard will display **Key shares successfully restored**. You can go to <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon" alt="Menu icon" /> → **My Public Key** to verify your TSS Node ID is the same as the one shown in Cobo Accounts.

After you complete all the items prompted in the dialog on the **Cobo Accounts** page, click **Link New Device**. Below are detailed instructions to link a new device:

1. Use Cobo Guard on your new device to scan the QR code that's displayed in the dialog on the Cobo Accounts page.

2. With your account successfully linked, the [Cobo Accounts](https://accounts.cobo.com/) page will display a **Security Verification** dialog.

4. With successful authentication, you will be redirected to the **MFA Management** tab.

Now you have completed the reset process.

3. Click **Cobo Guard not available?**, and use another MFA method for authentication.

<Note>If you have not set up any other MFA method, please contact [support](mailto:help@cobo.com).</Note>

4. With successful authentication, you will be redirected to the **MFA Management** tab. In the Cobo Guard on your new device, tap <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon" alt="The menu icon" /> and then **My Accounts**, you will see the email to which your Cobo Accounts is linked. That means your Cobo Guard has been successfully linked to Cobo Accounts.

<Note>As you used another MFA method instead of Cobo Guard for the authentication in the above step, your Cobo Accounts will be temporarily frozen. An [Admin](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) from your organization will need to unfreeze it. If you are the only member of your organization, the whole organization will be frozen for 24 hours. You can log in to the Cobo Portal after this period.</Note>

Now you have completed the reset process.
