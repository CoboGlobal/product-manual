If you are switching to a new iOS device, have lost access to your old device, or have reinstalled Cobo Guard, you will need to reset Cobo Guard on your new device to continue using it normally.

<Note>To avoid potential risks, we do not recommend uninstalling and reinstalling Cobo Guard on your device. If you mistakenly do so, you must also reset Cobo Guard. In this scenario, both “old device” and “new device” in this documentation refer to the same device.</Note>

## For Cobo Guard users that are key share holders

### Reset decision guide for key share holders

If your Cobo Guard serves as a key share holder and participates in MPC Wallet key management, please refer to the decision diagram below before resetting.

<Info>This is not a representation of the UI flow. The UI will show the steps that apply to your selected situation (see next section), which might not cover edge cases. This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of all possible key-share recovery paths under different conditions.</Info>

## Reference: steps to restore key share

<Note>Do not read this section out of context. Make sure you follow the previously described UI flow and are prompted to restore your key share.</Note>

You can go to <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon" alt="Menu icon" /> → **My Public Key** to verify your TSS Node ID is the same as the one shown in Cobo Accounts.

## Reference: steps to link new account

<Note>Do not read this section out of context. Make sure you follow the previously described UI flow, complete all the required steps, and are prompted to link your new account.</Note>

1. Use Cobo Guard on your new device to scan the QR code.

2. With your account successfully linked, the [Cobo Accounts](https://accounts.cobo.com/) page will display a **Security Verification** dialog.

<img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/security-verification.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="security verification" />

    - If you can access your old device, open Cobo Guard on it and choose **Approve**.
    - Otherwise, click **Cobo Guard not available?**, and use another MFA method for authentication.

    <Note>If you have not set up any other MFA method, please contact our [support team](mailto:help@cobo.com).</Note>

With successful authentication, you will be redirected to the **MFA Management** tab. In the Cobo Guard on your new device, tap <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon" alt="The menu icon" /> and then **My Accounts**, you will see the email to which your Cobo Accounts is linked. That means your Cobo Guard has been successfully linked to Cobo Accounts.

<Note>If you use another MFA method instead of Cobo Guard for the authentication in the above step, your Cobo Accounts will be temporarily frozen. An [Admin](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) from your organization will need to unfreeze it. If you are the only member of your organization, the whole organization will be frozen for 24 hours. You can log in to the Cobo Portal after this period.</Note>

Now you have completed the reset process.
