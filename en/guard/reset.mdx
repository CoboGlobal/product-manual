## Key share holder reset process

If your Cobo Guard serves as a key share holder and participates in MPC wallet key management, please refer to the following decision flowchart before resetting and choose the appropriate reset path based on your specific situation:

## 1. Download Cobo Guard

Download Cobo Guard and set up a PIN code on your new device. For detailed instructions, refer to [Download the Cobo Guard app](/en/guard/download).

## 2. Choose whether to restore key shares

After setting up the PIN code, you will be prompted to choose between **Link device to your account** or **Restore existing key shares first**.

### Restore key shares

<Note>The prerequisite for restoring key shares is that you have backed them up via iCloud on your old device. Please follow the instructions in [Back up your key shares](/en/guard/generate-and-back-up-key-shares#back-up-your-key-shares).</Note>

1. Choose **Restore existing key shares first**. Cobo Guard will begin to check your key share files.
2. Select the TSS Node IDs associated with the key shares you want to restore, then tap **Restore**.

3. Enter the recovery passphrase you set earlier when creating these backups for your key shares, then tap **Confirm**.
    <Warning>If you lose your recovery passphrase, you won't be able to restore your key shares from iCloud. Choose **Link device to your account** instead.</Warning>

    <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/restore3.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Screenshot of entering the passphrase" />

Cobo Guard will verify and restore your key shares. With the key shares successfully restored, a dialog showing "Key shares successfully restored" is displayed. Tap **OK**.

You can tap <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon" alt="The menu icon" /> and then **My Public Key** to view your public key and TSS Node ID. On the home screen, you can view the **Link Cobo Guard to your account** message.

### No need to restore key shares

If you don't need to restore key shares, choose **Link device to your account**.
<Warning>If you choose **Link device to your account** at this step, you will not be able to restore your private key shares afterward.</Warning>
On the home screen, you can view the **Link Cobo Guard to your account** message.

## 3. Link Cobo Accounts

1. Log in to [Cobo Accounts](https://accounts.cobo.com/) using an alternative MFA method, such as Google Authenticator. To learn more about Cobo Accounts, see [What are Cobo Accounts](/en/accounts/introduction).
    <Note>If you have not set up any other MFA method and cannot log in to your Cobo Account, please contact our [support team](mailto:help@cobo.com).</Note>
2. On the **Login Methods** tab or the **MFA Management** tab, click **Reset** next to **Cobo Guard**.

    <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/reset.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="The Reset button" />

3. Review the important information regarding the reset, then click **Confirm** to display a QR code.

  <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/reset_note.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="The information about the reset" />

4. Open Cobo Guard on your new device and scan the QR code.
5. On Cobo Guard, choose **Link**.
6. With your account successfully linked, the [Cobo Accounts](https://accounts.cobo.com/) page will display a message **Please open Cobo Guard on your old mobile device for authentication**.
    - If you can access your old device, open Cobo Guard on it and choose **Approve**.
    - Otherwise, click **Cobo Guard not available?** on the page, and use another MFA method for authentication.
    <Note>If you have not set up any other MFA method, please contact our [support team](mailto:help@cobo.com).</Note>
With successful authentication, you will be redirected to the **MFA Management** tab. Open Cobo Guard on your new device, tap <img src="/en/images/cobo-guard/common/icon_menu.svg" className="icon" alt="The menu icon" /> and then **My Accounts**, you will see the email to which your Cobo Accounts is linked. That means your Cobo Guard has been successfully linked to Cobo Accounts.

<Note>If you use another MFA method instead of Cobo Guard for the authentication in the above step, your Cobo Accounts will be temporarily frozen. An [Admin](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) from your organization will need to unfreeze it. If you are the only member of your organization, the whole organization will be frozen for 24 hours. You can log in to the Cobo Portal after this period.</Note>

Now you have completed the reset process.
