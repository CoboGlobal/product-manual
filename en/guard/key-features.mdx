## Key share manager
Securely generate, back up, and manage MPC key shares to strengthen asset protection and minimize the risk of single points of failure. By distributing key shares across multiple parties or devices, Cobo Guard ensures that no single entity has full control over private keys, enhancing overall security.

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) method

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security to Cobo Portal by requiring a second verification step beyond your password. This helps prevent unauthorized access, even if your password is compromised.  

Cobo Guard acts as an MFA option, allowing you to quickly verify logins and sensitive operations, such as inviting new users or modifying risk controls. With a simple approval in the Cobo Guard app, you can confirm actions and ensure your account remains protected.

## Operation approval

Cobo Guard allows you to approve operations initiated by other users within the organization, such as transactions, organization management, and risk control changes. This ensures that sensitive actions undergo proper oversight before being executed.  

Certain operations, based on risk control settings, require approval from designated members. Cobo Guard notifies the approvers, enabling them to review and authorize these requests directly through the app.  

The following table lists operations that require approval through Cobo Guard:
