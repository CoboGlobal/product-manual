## Key features

### For asset managers

- Increased confidence: Trade on exchanges with greater confidence and efficiency.
- Minimized counterparty risk: Remove the need to pre-fund on exchanges, reducing exposure to counterparty risk.
- Capital efficiency: Allocate assets to supported exchanges instantly, reducing delays from on-chain transfers.
- Regulatory compliance: SuperLoop adds an extra layer of security and helps meet regulatory requirements.

### For exchanges

- Increased trading activity: Attract more asset managers and higher trading volumes by eliminating pre-funding requirements.
- Counterparty risk mitigation: Ensure asset managers can meet their obligations before executing trades, mitigating counterparty risk.
- Regulatory compliance: SuperLoop enhances security measures and supports compliance with regulatory standards.

## How it works

### Pre-trade

- Asset managers link[ Exchange Wallets](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/introduction) to SuperLoop on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login). <Note>The Exchange Wallets must have already been set up. See [Set up Exchange Wallets](/en/portal/exchange-wallets/set-up).</Note>
- Asset managers request to mirror assets on linked exchange accounts via SuperLoop. The mirrored assets will come from one of the asset managers' chosen [Custodial Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/introduction) or [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction).
- Assets will be locked in SuperLoop and mirrored 1:1 on linked exchange accounts.

### During-trade

- Asset managers submit trade orders to the exchanges and trade as per usual.

### Post-trade

- Automated settlements take place periodically.
- Exchanges provide net settlement amount to Cobo.
