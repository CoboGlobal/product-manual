## Post-screening policies

Post-screening policies automatically handle transactions based on their screening results. Each policy defines when it should apply (criteria) and what action to take when it matches.

<Info>
To access this feature:
1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login)
2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> to open Cobo Portal Apps
3. Find and open **Screening**
4. Click **Post-Screening Policies**
</Info>

The **Post-Screening Policies** interface enables you to manage your post-screening policies.

- Post-Screening Policies when using CipherOwl as the AML provider:
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/manage-post-screening-policies-cipherowl.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Manage Post-Screening Policies interface showing list of policies with edit and delete options"/>

- Post-Screening Policies when using Elliptic as the AML provider:
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/manage-post-screening-policies-elliptic.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Manage Post-Screening Policies interface showing list of policies with edit and delete options"/>

You can filter the policies by Direction, Risk, USD Amount, Decision, AML Provider (CipherOwl or Elliptic), and Updated Time.

## Creating, editing, and deleting policies

<Note>Select and configure your preferred AML provider in [Settings](/en/apps/screening/screening-settings#aml-provider-settings) first.</Note>

### Creating policies

To create a new policy:
1. Go to the [Post-Screening Policies interface].(#the-post-screening-policies-interface)
2. Click **Create Policy**.
  - Create Post-Screening Policy dialog when using CipherOwl
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/creating-post-screening-policy-cipherowl.svg" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Create Post-Screening Policy dialog when using CipherOwl"/>

  - Create Post-Screening Policy dialog when using Elliptic
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/creating-post-screening-policy-elliptic.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Create Post-Screening Policy dialog when using Elliptic"/>

3. Define policy criteria and action.

**Policy criteria**
<table class="table six-columns">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Policy Criteria</th>
      <th>Options</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Direction</td>
      <td>• Inbound<br/>• Outbound</td>
      <td>Transaction flow direction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Risk</td>
      <td>When using CipherOwl:<br/>• Low<br/>• Medium<br/>• High<br/><br/>When using Elliptic:<br/>• NA<br/>• Numerical score from 0.0 to 10.0 (in 0.1 increments)</td>
      <td>CipherOwl: Risk classification from [CipherOwl](https://s.cipherowl.ai/Address-Risk-Score-1a0d90dd030f80b5904cd4aa76e15cea)<br/><br/>Elliptic: Numerical risk score with higher values indicating higher risk. For details, see [Elliptic's Risk Score documentation](https://help.elliptic.co/en/articles/2641454-interpreting-risk-scores).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Amount Range</td>
      <td>• Min Amount<br/>• Max Amount</td>
      <td>Transaction value range (in USD)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Policy actions**
<table class="table six-columns">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Decision</th>
      <th>Effect on transaction</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Approve</td>
      <td>• Inbound: Release funds<br/>• Outbound: Allow to proceed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Approve with Alert</td>
      <td>• Inbound: Release funds + notification<br/>• Outbound: Allow + notification</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reject</td>
      <td>• Inbound:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Flag transactions and freeze funds <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Note: If you are using the [auto token sweeping feature of MPC Wallets](/en/portal/auto-sweep-overview), frozen funds will not be included in the sweep operation.<br/>• Outbound: Block transaction<br/>• Risk notification is always sent</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

4. Click **Submit** to enable the policy.

<Note>
When Screening has the scan results:
- Due to [overlap prevention rules](#overlap-prevention-rules), at most one policy will match any given transaction
- A policy matches when the transaction's direction, risk level (CipherOwl) or risk score (Elliptic), and amount range match the policy's criteria
- When a match is found, Screening executes that policy's action
</Note>

<Warning>If no policy matches, the transaction is automatically proceeded **without risk assessment**. To ensure proper risk management, make sure to set up appropriate policies that cover all your transaction scenarios before using Screening.</Warning>

#### Overlap prevention rules
The system prevents creation of overlapping policies. A policy cannot be created if it has all of the following in common with an existing active policy:
- Same direction (Inbound/Outbound)
- Same risk level/score range
- Overlapping amount range

For example:
```
Policy 1: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 500 + < 1000 USD (Valid)
Policy 2: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 400 + < 7000 USD (Invalid - amount range overlaps with Policy 1)
Policy 2: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 600 + < 700 USD (Invalid - amount range overlaps with Policy 1)
Policy 2: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 1000 + < 7000 USD (Valid - amount range does not overlap)
Policy 3: Outbound + Medium risk + ≥ 1000 + < 7000 USD (Valid - different direction)
```

<Warning>
The policy examples above are for illustration purposes only. Your actual policies should be tailored to your organization's specific compliance requirements and risk management strategy.

For guidance on risk assessment and policy creation, refer to CipherOwl's [Address Risk Score](https://s.cipherowl.ai/Address-Risk-Score-1a0d90dd030f80b5904cd4aa76e15cea) documentation or consult with their compliance experts via [CipherOwl](https://www.cipherowl.com/)'s website. For Elliptic's risk scoring system, refer to their [Interpreting Risk Scores](https://help.elliptic.co/en/articles/2641454-interpreting-risk-scores) and [Configuring Your Risk Rules](https://help.elliptic.co/en/articles/8216353-configuring-your-risk-rules) documentation.
</Warning>
