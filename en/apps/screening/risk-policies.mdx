---

Post-screening policies automatically handle transactions based on their screening results. Each policy defines when it should apply (criteria) and what action to take when it matches.

## **Post-Screening Policies** interface

<Info>
To access this feature:
1. Log in to [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login)
2. Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> to open Cobo Portal Apps
3. Find and open **Screening**
4. Click **Post-Screening Policies**
</Info>

The **Post-Screening Policies** interface enables you to manage your post-screening policies.

- Post-Screening Policies when using CipherOwl as the AML provider:
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/manage-post-screening-policies-cipherowl.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Manage Post-Screening Policies interface showing list of policies with edit and delete options"/>

- Post-Screening Policies when using Elliptic as the AML provider:
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/manage-post-screening-policies-elliptic.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Manage Post-Screening Policies interface showing list of policies with edit and delete options"/>

You can filter the policies by Direction, Risk, USD Amount, Decision, AML Provider (CipherOwl or Elliptic), and Updated Time.

## Create, edit, and delete policies

<Note>Select and configure your preferred AML provider in [Settings](/en/apps/screening/screening-settings#aml-provider-settings) first.</Note>

### Create policies

1. Go to the [Post-Screening Policies interface](#the-post-screening-policies-interface).
2. Click **Create Policy**.
  - **Create Post-Screening Policy** dialog when using CipherOwl:
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/creating-post-screening-policy-cipherowl.svg" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Create Post-Screening Policy dialog when using CipherOwl"/>

  - **Create Post-Screening Policy** dialog when using Elliptic:
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/screening/creating-post-screening-policy-elliptic.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Create Post-Screening Policy dialog when using Elliptic"/>

3. Define policy criteria and action.

**Policy criteria**
<table class="table six-columns">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Policy Criteria</th>
      <th>Options</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Direction</td>
      <td>• Inbound<br/>• Outbound</td>
      <td>Transaction flow direction</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Risk</td>
      <td>When using CipherOwl:<br/>• Low<br/>• Medium<br/>• High<br/><br/>When using Elliptic:<br/>• NA<br/>• Numerical score from 0.0 to 10.0 (in 0.1 increments)</td>
      <td>CipherOwl: Risk classification from [CipherOwl](https://s.cipherowl.ai/Address-Risk-Score-1a0d90dd030f80b5904cd4aa76e15cea)<br/><br/>Elliptic: Numerical risk score with higher values indicating higher risk (see [Elliptic's Risk Score documentation](https://help.elliptic.co/en/articles/2641454-interpreting-risk-scores))</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Amount Range</td>
      <td>• Min Amount<br/>• Max Amount</td>
      <td>Transaction value range (in USD)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Policy actions**
<table class="table six-columns">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Decision</th>
      <th>Effect on transaction</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Approve</td>
      <td>• Inbound: Release funds<br/>• Outbound: Allow to proceed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Approve with Alert</td>
      <td>• Inbound: Release funds + notification<br/>• Outbound: Allow + notification</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Reject</td>
      <td>• Inbound:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;• Flag transactions and freeze funds <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Note: If you are using the [auto token sweeping feature of MPC Wallets](/en/portal/auto-sweep-overview), frozen funds will not be included in the sweep operation.<br/>• Outbound: Block transaction<br/>• Risk notification is always sent</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

4. Click **Submit** to enable the policy.

<Note>
When Screening has the scan results:
- Due to [overlap prevention rules](#overlap-prevention-rules), at most one policy will match any given transaction
- A policy matches when the transaction's direction, risk level (CipherOwl) or risk score (Elliptic), and amount range match the policy's criteria
- When a match is found, Screening executes that policy's action
</Note>

<Warning>If no policy matches, the transaction is automatically approved. To ensure proper risk management, make sure to set up appropriate policies that cover all your transaction scenarios before using Screening.</Warning>

#### Overlap prevention rules
The system prevents creation of overlapping policies. A policy cannot be created if it has all of the following in common with an existing active policy:
- Same direction (Inbound/Outbound)
- Same risk level/score range
- Overlapping amount range

For example:
```
Policy 1: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 500 + < 1000 USD (Valid)
Policy 2: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 400 + < 7000 USD (Invalid - amount range overlaps with Policy 1)
Policy 2: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 600 + < 700 USD (Invalid - amount range overlaps with Policy 1)
Policy 2: Inbound + Medium risk + ≥ 1000 + < 7000 USD (Valid - amount range does not overlap)
Policy 3: Outbound + Medium risk + ≥ 1000 + < 7000 USD (Valid - different direction)
```

<Warning>
The policy examples above are for illustration purposes only. Your actual policies should be tailored to your organization's specific compliance requirements and risk management strategy.

For CipherOwl, refer to CipherOwl's [Address Risk Score](https://s.cipherowl.ai/Address-Risk-Score-1a0d90dd030f80b5904cd4aa76e15cea) documentation or consult with their compliance experts via [CipherOwl](https://www.cipherowl.com/)'s website. 
For Elliptic, refer to their [Interpreting Risk Scores](https://help.elliptic.co/en/articles/2641454-interpreting-risk-scores) and [Configuring Your Risk Rules](https://help.elliptic.co/en/articles/8216353-configuring-your-risk-rules) documentation.
</Warning>
