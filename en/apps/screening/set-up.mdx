Screening is a [Cobo Portal App](/en/apps/introduction). To install Screening, follow the instructions in [Browse and install apps](/en/apps/browse-and-install).

<Note>CipherOwl directly scans transactions, while using Elliptic requires [API key configuration](/en/apps/screening/screening-settings#aml-provider-settings) before use.</Note>

<Note>During [installation](/en/apps/browse-and-install), you will be asked to select which [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) and [Web3 Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/web3-wallets/set-up) the app can access in the **Wallet Scopes** section. Screening will automatically scan every transaction for the selected wallets. You can modify these wallet selections later by following the instructions in [Manage monitored wallets](/en/apps/screening/settings).</Note>

<Warning>
**Important**: After installation, make sure to set up appropriate [post-screening policies](/en/apps/screening/risk-policies) before using Screening. Without any policies configured, transactions will proceed without proper risk assessment, which could expose your assets to potential risks.
</Warning>

<Note>While CipherOwl is immediately available after installation, using Elliptic requires configuring an API Key first. You will need to obtain an API Key from Elliptic and [configure it within the Screening app](/en/apps/screening/screening-settings#aml-provider-settings).</Note>
