## What is Screening?

Screening is a [Cobo Portal App](/en/apps/introduction) that streamlines Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) compliance through automated transaction monitoring. Using advanced Know Your Address (KYA) and Know Your Transaction (KYT) capabilities, it provides comprehensive protection for your selected [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) and [Web3 Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/web3-wallets/set-up) while your team focuses on business growth.

Once [installed](/en/apps/screening/set-up) and configured, the app continuously monitors transactions in real-time, providing intelligent risk detection and automated compliance controls. 

<Note>CipherOwl directly scans transactions, while using Elliptic requires [API key configuration](/en/apps/screening/screening-settings#aml-provider-settings) before use.</Note>

## Key features

### Intelligent risk detection

Screening automatically analyzes transactions in real-time using advanced risk assessment technology through our integrations with leading compliance solution providers:

- [CipherOwl](https://www.cipherowl.com/): Ready to use for transaction screening immediately after installing Screening.
- [Elliptic](https://www.elliptic.co/): Requires API key configuration before use. Contact [Cobo Support](mailto:help@cobo.com) to obtain API keys.

The screening results provide a smart risk assessment: 
  - With CipherOwl: Transactions are automatically classified into three risk levels (Low, Medium, High) based on CipherOwl's risk scoring system. For details, see [CipherOwl's Address Risk Score documentation](https://s.cipherowl.ai/Address-Risk-Score-1a0d90dd030f80b5904cd4aa76e15cea).
  - With Elliptic: Risk is presented as a numerical score from 0.0 to 10.0 (in 0.1 increments), with higher scores indicating higher risk levels. For details, see [Elliptic's Risk Score documentation](https://help.elliptic.co/en/articles/2641454-interpreting-risk-scores).
   
   You can then decide how to manage transactions based on their assigned risk levels or scores.

<Info>
When a transaction in your [selected monitored wallets](/en/apps/screening/settings) is being screened, Cobo transmits the following transaction details to your AML provider for risk assessment:
- With CihperOwl: Asset's chain, From address (for deposits), To address (for withdrawals)
- With Elliptic: Asset's chain, Receiving address (for withdrawals), On-chain transaction hash (for deposits)
</Info>

### Automated defense and risk management

After Screening analyzes transactions, automatically handle them based on your configured post-screening policies:

- [**Post-screening policies**](/en/apps/screening/risk-policies):
  Define policies using these criteria:
  - Transaction direction (Inbound/Outbound)
  - Risk (Low/Medium/High for CipherOwl; 0.0-10.0 numerical score for Elliptic)
  - Amount range (Min-Max in USD)

- **Automated responses**:
  When a policy matches, automatically:
  - **Approve**: Allow transactions to proceed
  - **Approve with Alert**: Allow transactions and send risk notification
  - **Reject**:
    - For inbound transactions: Funds will be frozen
    - For outbound transactions: The transaction is blocked
    - Risk notification is always sent

### Unified compliance dashboard

Manage all compliance activities efficiently through an intuitive timeline view that provides:

- Real-time risk assessment tracking and review status
- Transaction fund status monitoring
- Complete audit trails and action histories

This centralized timeline interface ensures all compliance activities and their histories are easily accessible in one place.
