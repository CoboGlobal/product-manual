This guide walks you through how to use the swap feature.

<Info>Currently, cross-chain swaps are not supported. To move assets across chains, please use the [Bridge](/en/apps/token-swap/bridge/introduction) feature.</Info>

## Prerequisites
- You have installed Token Swap as described in [Browse and install apps](/en/apps/browse-and-install).
- You have been assigned the [Spender](/en/portal/risk-controls/roles-and-permissions) role or a role with equivalent permissions.
- You are swapping a token from a [Custodial Wallet](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/introduction) or [MPC Wallet](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction).
- The involved wallet has been selected in the wallet scope for the Token Swap app. Refer to Step 5 in [Browse and install apps](/en/apps/browse-and-install).
- The token you are swapping is a supported token type. See the [Supported Assets](/en/apps/token-swap/swap/supported-assets) list for details.

4. Select the wallet, choose the source and destination tokens, and enter the amount to swap.
<Note>If your wallet or token does not appear in the list, make sure the wallet is selected in the wallet scope for Token Swap and that the token is a supported token type.</Note>
5. Review the quoted price, processing fee, and estimated time. Then click **Preview**.
