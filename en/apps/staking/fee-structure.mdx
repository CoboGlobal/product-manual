The following documentation explains the commission fees applied to staking rewards.

## BTC Staking

For BTC staking with [Babylon](https://babylonlabs.io/), when Cobo acts as the Finality Provider, the commission fee is 5% of the staking rewards.

## ETH Staking

For ETH staking on the [Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/), [Stakefish](https://stake.fish/products/classic-staking) and [Figment](https://figment.io/) are the supported Ethereum Node Providers, with plans to add support for other Node Providers in the future. Fees may vary depending on the Node Provider.

ETH staking rewards are divided into two parts: Consensus Layer Rewards and Execution Layer Rewards.

- **Consensus Layer Rewards**: These rewards are generated from block production and are directly distributed to your Withdrawal Address with no rewards shared with Cobo and the Node Provider.
- **Execution Layer Rewards**: This includes rewards such as MEV (Maximal Extractable Value), tips, and transaction fees. The distribution of these rewards varies depending on the Node Provider. **Only the Execution Layer Rewards are relevant for fee calculations**.

The reward distribution structure for Stakefish and Figment is as follows:

<Note>
- Note that the distribution ratio between Consensus Layer and Execution Layer is for illustration only;
- The commission is always 10% of total rewards, and the commission percentage on Execution Layer rewards will be dynamically adjusted based on the actual Consensus/Execution Layer distribution ratio;
- User reward examples are based on hypothetical reward rates and do not represent actual performance.
</Note>

| Consensus Layer Rewards | Execution Layer Rewards | Commission Fee | User Reward Example |
|------------------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 80% of total rewards | 20% of total rewards<br></br>- Stakefish: Execution Layer rewards must be claimed by staking addresses<br></br>- Figment: Execution Layer rewards are automatically distributed through smart contracts deployed by Figment | 10% of total rewards<br></br>(when Execution Layer rewards are 20% of total rewards, this equals 50% of Execution Layer rewards) | - Consensus Layer: 2.8%<br></br>- Execution Layer (before fee): 0.7%<br></br>- Execution Layer (after fee): 0.35%<br></br>- Total: 3.15%|
