<Info>Currently, the Staking app supports staking BTC ([Babylon](https://babylonlabs.io/)) and ETH ([Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/)) within [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) in [Organization-Controlled Vaults](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-mpc-vault).</Info>

Select the **BTC** or **ETH** tab to view specific instructions for each.

   Babylon offers two methods to withdraw assets:

   - Early unstaking: You need to unstake (officially referred to as **unbond** by Babylon) first and then withdraw.
   - Natural expiration: You can directly withdraw your assets without the need to unstake first.

   Follow these steps to unstake assets before expiraion.

   <Note>Prerequisite 1: You have [staked](/en/apps/staking/stake) BTC in an MPC Wallet in an Organization-Controlled Vault. The wallet has not been moved out of [**Wallet Scopes**](/en/portal/portal-apps/app-settings) accessible by Staking.</Note>

   <Note>Prerequisite 2: You need to have the [Staker](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role to unstake assets.</Note>

   1. Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), find **Staking**, then click **Open** to open Staking.
   2. Click **View** under **Actions** in the row for Babylon.
   3. On the staking details page, click **Unstake** under **Actions** in the row of the staking position that you want to unstake. 

      - The **Unstake** button appears only in the rows of the staking positions with the status **Active** or **Limit exceeded**.
      - For Babylon, you can only unstake the whole amount; partial unstaking is not allowed.

   4. Review the information in the pop-up window and click **Submit**. Note that the Babylon protocol does not support customizing your fee rate for unstaking. You need to have sufficient balance for the network fee to submit the transaction.
   5. In the **Unstaking Request Submitted** window, click **Staking Activity** to go to the staking details page.
   6. On the staking details page, you can find the following updates.

      - Under **Staking Positions**, the **Position Status** is updated to **Unstaking in Progress**.
         - If the unstaking succeeds, the **Position Status** will become **Withdrawable**, and a **Withdraw** button will appear under **Actions**.
         - If the unstaking fails, the **Position Status** will change back to **Active**, and the **Unstake** button will appear under **Actions**.
      - Under **Activity**, a record is created, and its **Activity Status** is **Processing**. If the unstaking request is rejected by risk control policies or signers, the status will be **Failed**; otherwise, it stays as **Processing**. Depending on whether Babylon confirms the transaction, the final status will be **Success** or **Failed**.

(Alternatively, you can click **Check** to open the **Validator Public Key List** and select validators to unstake first.)
      4. Enter the number of validators to unstake. By default, the validators with the lowest APY will be selected. You can also click **Select Validators** to select specific validators, which are listed in ascending order based on APY. Click **Submit**.

         <Info>Unstaking does not require going on-chain and incurs no network fees.</Info>

         - Under **Staking Positions**, the **Status** of the ETH is updated to **Unstaking in Progress**. You can click **Check** to view the list of validators being unstaked.
            - If the unstaking succeeds, the row for the unstaked **ETH** will not be shown. The validator status will be **Closed**.
            - If the unstaking fails, the **Status** will change back to **Active**, and the **Unstake** button will appear under **Actions**.

         - Under **Activity**, a record is created, and its **Activity Status** is **Processing**. The final status will be **Success** or **Failed**.

      7. When the unstaking succeeds, the assets will be transferred to your Withdrawal Address.
