<Info>The Staking app supports staking BTC ([Babylon](https://babylonlabs.io/)) and ETH ([Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/)) within [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) in [Organization-Controlled Vaults](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-mpc-vault).</Info>

<Note>Prerequisite: All user roles can view staking positions and activity. To stake, unstake, or withdraw assets, you need to have the [Staker](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role.</Note>

Select the **BTC** or **ETH** tab to view specific instructions for each.

    **Position Status** depends on the result of your staking operations. For detailed explanations, see the documentation for [Stake](/en/apps/staking/stake), [Unstake](/en/apps/staking/unstake), and [Withdraw](/en/apps/staking/withdraw).

    You can click the row of a staking position to view more details, including **Position ID** and **Activity Timeline**. In the **Activity Timeline** section, click the blue hyperlinked text (for example, **BTC Confirmation**) to view the detailed status of the step.

    **Activity Status** depends on the result of your staking operations. For BTC staking with Babylon, the **Activity Status** stays as **Processing** before the transaction is confirmed by Babylon. If the transaction is rejected by risk control policies or signers, the status will be **Failed**. If it passes, depending on whether Babylon confirms the transaction, the final status will be **Success** or **Failed**.

    <Info>Withdrawal does not require confirmation from Babylon; the status will be **Success** when it goes on-chain.</Info>

    You can click the row of an activity to view more details, including **Position ID** and **Timeline**. In the **Timeline** section, click the blue hyperlinked text (for example, **BTC Confirmation**) to view the detailed status of the step.
