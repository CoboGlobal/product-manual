<Info>The Staking app supports staking BTC ([Babylon](https://babylonlabs.io/)) and ETH ([Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/beacon-chain/)) within [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) in [Organization-Controlled Vaults](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/ocw/create-mpc-vault). For ETH, assets are automatically transferred to your Withdrawal Address after unstaking, so no further withdrawal action is needed. The following documentation covers BTC withdrawal for Babylon only.</Info>

Babylon offers two methods to withdraw assets:

- Early unstaking: You need to [unstake](/en/apps/staking/unstake) (officially referred to as **unbond** by Babylon) first and then withdraw.
- Natural expiration: You can directly withdraw your assets without the need to unstake first.

Follow these steps to withdraw assets.

<Note>Prerequisite 1: You have unstaked BTC or BTC that has naturally expired in an MPC Wallet in an Organization-Controlled Vault. The wallet has not been moved out of [**Wallet Scopes**](/en/apps/app-settings) accessible by Staking.</Note>

<Note>Prerequisite 2: You need to have the [Staker](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role to withdraw assets.</Note>

1. Click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon"/> on [Cobo Portal](https://portal.cobo.com/login), find **Staking**, then click **Open** to open Staking.
2. Click **View** under **Actions** in the row for Babylon.
3. Click **Withdraw** in the row of the staking position from which you want to withdraw. The **Withdraw** button appears only in the rows of the staking positions with the status **Withdrawable**.
4. Review the information in the pop-up window. Select a receiving wallet. For **Network Fee**, select from **Slow**, **Standard**, and **Fast**. You can also customize your fee rate by clicking <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/staking/setting.svg" className="icon" alt="The customize fee icon"/>. 
5. Click **Submit**. You need to have sufficient balance for the network fee to submit the transaction.
6. In the **Withdrawal Request Submitted** window, click **Staking Activity** to go to the staking details page.
7. On the staking details page, you can find the following updates.

    - Under **Staking Positions**, the **Position Status** is updated to **Withdrawal in Progress**.
        - If the withdrawal succeeds, the **Position Status** will become **Closed**. The assets are transferred back to your wallet.
        - If the withdrawal fails, the **Position Status** will change back to **Withdrawable**, and the **Withdraw** button will appear under **Actions**.
    - Under **Activity**, a record is created, and its **Activity Status** is **Processing**. If the withdrawl request is rejected by risk control policies or signers, the status will be **Failed**; otherwise, it stays as **Processing**. When the transaction goes on-chain, the status will be **Success**.
        <Info> Withdrawal does not require confirmation from Babylon.</Info>
