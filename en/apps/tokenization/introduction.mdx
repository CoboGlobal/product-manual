Tokenization simplifies how you issue, manage, and operate your own tokens—no technical expertise needed.

## Why issue your own tokens?

- **For asset/fund managers**: Tokenize the art, antiques, or real estate funds you manage to easily fractionalize shares, attract global investors, and increase asset liquidity.

- **For stablecoin issuers**: Quickly and securely issue and manage your own stablecoins to build an efficient and reliable settlement system for your ecosystem.

- **For exchanges**: Tokenize traditional financial assets like stocks to offer innovative investment products to your users.

## Key features of the Tokenization app

### Versatile token creation
Design and issue tokens tailored to your business needs, covering a wide range of use cases from stablecoins and security tokens to the tokenization of real-world assets.

### Built on a secure foundation

Cobo’s tokenization solution is built on secure and compliant token standards, reinforced with a multi-layered security and risk control framework.

We support token creation on multiple blockchain platforms, based on secure token standards:

- **CoboERC20 smart contract**: Extends the standard [ERC-20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc20) with enhanced features for access control and lifecycle management. The contract has undergone professional security auditing by third-party firm BlockSec to ensure high security standards. See the [Security Audit Report for CoboTokenization](https://d.cobo.com/public/documents/blocksec_CoboTokenization_v1.0-signed.pdf). Currently supported chains are ETH and BSC.
- [**Solana Token-2022 Program**](https://www.solana-program.com/docs/token-2022): Built on Solana's native token standard, providing high-performance and low-cost token operations.

The security and risk control framework ensure transparency and control throughout the token lifecycle:

1. **Granular permission controls on contract level**

  At the smart contract level, only designated signing addresses are authorized to perform sensitive operations such as mint, burn, and pause contract. Contracts accept signatures exclusively from these addresses to ensure secure control.

2. **Team governance and approval controls**  

  Within the Cobo Portal, internal roles and permissions are clearly defined—for example, who can submit a mint request. Multi-level approval workflows ensure sensitive operations must be initiated by compliant members and executed only after approval.  

3. **Signature risk control mechanism**  
   
  Once approved, according to the private key configuration and MPC signature rules of the authorized addresses, the system ensures every transaction requires compliant key signing before being submitted on-chain.

### Complete lifecycle management
Manage **every stage of your token's lifecycle** through a single, intuitive interface—no coding required. Securely mint new tokens for issuance, burn them upon redemption, pause the contract in an emergency, and seamlessly upgrade it to add new features.

[API access](https://www.cobo.com/developers/v2/api-references/tokenization/issue-token) is supported for programmatical management of token operations.

### Robust token access controls
Enforce compliance and security at the smart contract level. Set up **token access** controls to restrict token interactions to verified, eligible investors and a **blocklist** to prevent any interaction with unauthorized or suspicious addresses.

## How it works

The Tokenization app supports operations through both MPC Wallets and Custodial Wallets (Web3 Wallets) on Cobo Portal.

<Info>Unless otherwise specified, all screenshots shown below use EVM chain (CoboERC20 smart contract) as examples.</Info>

### 1. Preparation

1. Set up your Cobo Portal account and MPC Wallet: Follow the steps in the [MPC Wallets production usage guide](/en/portal/quick-start-guide-mpc) or [Custodial Wallets production usage guide](/en/portal/quick-start-guide-custodial-wallets). 
2. Install the Tokenization App: Follow the steps in [Browse and install apps](/en/apps/browse-and-install). 

### 2. Create your token
Easily create and issue your own tokens. You can also update token information as needed.

In the Tokenization app you just installed, click **Create your first token**.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/create-button.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="click create your first token"/>

In the pop-up window, select your use case for the token.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/create-token1.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Create token window1"/>

After you choose your use case, click **Continue** to start configuring token details.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/create-token2.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Create token window2"/>

### 3. Manage token access controls and permissions

Find your token on the Tokenization landing page and click the corresponding button for the following operations.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/menu.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="菜单"/>

#### Set up token access and blocklist

Use token access settings and blocklist to control who can interact with your tokens. Note that different token standards may have different logic.

- **Token access**:
  - **CoboERC20 smart contract**: It's recommended to enable **Restricted Access** to activate an allowlist, limiting all token circulation exclusively to addresses that are on your allowlist AND not on the blocklist.

    <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/token-access-coboerc20.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="CoboERC20 token access"/>

  - **Solana Token-2022 Program**: After enabling **address restrictions**, newly created token accounts will be frozen by default, while existing accounts remain unaffected. You can **authorize** new accounts on the interface shown in the screenshot below to unfreeze them. Once unfrozen, these accounts can send and receive tokens normally, and tokens can only circulate between unfrozen addresses. If address restrictions are not enabled, tokens are publicly available on the market.

    <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/token-access-solana.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Solana token access"/>

- **Blocklist**: Addresses on the blocklist are prevented from performing any token operations.

    <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/blocklist.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="blocklist"/>

#### Manage permissions

Different token standards have different mechanisms for permission management:

- **CoboERC20 smart contract**:
  - Permissions can be assigned, modified, or removed during token creation and after creation
  - Supports assigning the same permission to multiple addresses
  - Permissions include administrative privileges, token minting, contract pausing, etc.

    <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/permissions-coboerc20.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="CoboERC20 manage permissions"/>

- **Solana Token-2022 Program**:
  - Permissions can only be assigned during token creation; after token creation, permissions cannot be assigned or removed (only permission holders can transfer their permissions to other addresses); Permanent Delegate permissions cannot be modified once set
  - Each permission corresponds to only one wallet address
  - Permissions include token minting, account freezing, etc.

    <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/permissions-solana.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Solana manage permissions"/>

### 4. Day-to-day operations

#### Perform core lifecycle operations

Find your token on the Tokenization landing page and click the corresponding button for the following operations.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/menu2.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="day-to-day operations"/>

- **Mint:** Issue new tokens to increase the total supply, for example, when new investors subscribe.
  
  <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/mint.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Mint token window"/>

- **Burn:** Permanently remove tokens from circulation, for example, when processing investor redemptions.

  <Note>
  **Note:**
  For the CoboERC20 smart contract,
    - When you click **Mint** or **Burn**, you need to enter the token amount in readable format (for example, entering 1 = 1 token). 
    - When you click **More Actions** to access contract functions and call **mint** and **burn**, you need to enter the raw amount (for example, for a 6-decimal token, entering 1,000,000 = 1 token). 
  
  Make sure you check the input hints in the UI to enter the correct amount.
  </Note>

- **Pause/Unpause:** Instantly freeze or resume all token activities (transfers, minting, burning) to respond to emergencies or security threats.

#### Monitor activity

View detailed information on token holders and track a complete history of all operations for transparent oversight.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/menu4.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Holdings"/>
<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/menu5.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Execution history"/>

#### Interact directly with the contract

For maximum flexibility and advanced use cases, you can interact directly with your token's smart contract through a visual interface. This enables access to all contract functions beyond the main UI features.

Click **More Actions** to enter the contract interaction page.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/menu3.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="合约交互"/>

For detailed information about CoboERC20 and Solana Token-2022 Program contract capabilities, see [Operating contracts](/en/apps/tokenization/contract).

### 5. Risk controls

#### Approval workflow

The Tokenization app has a built-in flexible approval workflow to ensure that token operations undergo proper review. It has preset approval workflows for core token operations, including minting, burning, pause/unpause, permission management, and other key operations.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/workflow.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Token operations with approval workflow"/>

You can modify the conditions and corresponding actions of the approval workflow according to your business needs.

<img src="/en/images/portal-apps/tokenization/edit-workflow.png" className="screenshot_modal" alt="Edit approval workflow"/>

<Note>For more information about app approval workflows and detailed instructions, please refer to [View and update approval workflows](/en/apps/workflow).</Note>

When a token operation is initiated, it will automatically enter the approval workflow. On the **Execution History** page, you can see that the operation status is **Pending Approval**. After approval is granted, the Tokenization app will construct the corresponding on-chain transaction.

#### Transaction policies

After passing the app approval workflow, the operation enters transaction policy approval.

The default risk control rules are as follows (listed in order of application):

1. Contract calls initiated by the Tokenization app require approval from one Admin
2. Large single withdrawals (> USD 10,000) require approval from one Admin
3. Regular transfers that don't match the above conditions are automatically approved
4. All other transactions are automatically rejected

You can modify the rules according to your business needs.

<Note>On the **Transaction Policies** page, under **Operations**, click <img src="/en/images/common/icon_more.svg" className="icon"/> > <img src="/en/images/common/icon_edit.svg" className="icon"/> **Edit** or <img src="/en/images/common/icon_delete.svg" className="icon"/> **Delete** next to the rule you want to modify or delete.</Note>
