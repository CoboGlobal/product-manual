This article describes how to make a batch payout in the Batch Payouts app.

## Prerequisites

- You have installed Batch Payouts as described in [Browse and install apps](/en/apps/browse-and-install).

    <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/set-up.png" className="screenshot_full_screen" alt="Image showing Batch Payouts as a Cobo Portal App."/>

- You have been assigned the [Admin](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role, the [Spender](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role, or a customized role with equivalent permissions.

## Steps

1. Click the Apps icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon" /> on Cobo Portal, find Batch Payouts, and then click **Open** to open the app.
2. In the app, click **Make a Payout**.

3. On the **Make a Payout** page, select the token type that you want to transfer in the **Token** section.
4. In the **From** section, select the wallet from which the transfer will be made.
    <Note>Currently Exchange Wallets are not supported for a batch payout.</Note>
5. In the **Add the Payouts** section, you can enable the **Recipient Confirmation on Cobo Guard** option. This option ensures transfer will only complete after recipients confirm on Cobo Guard. Therefore, all recipients' emails must be a Cobo Account and linked to Cobo Guard. If any recipient's email does not meet these requirements, you will not be able to submit the payout. You can use the **Send Setup Guide To These Emails** button to send instructional emails to help them complete Cobo Accounts registration and link Cobo Guard.
6. Specify the details for each recipient as follows:
    - **Receiving address**: Enter the recipient's address manually, or import it from your Address Book or a CSV file.
    - **Amount to Receive**: Specify the transfer amount.

        <Note>If the total payout amount is more than 100 USD, the payout will trigger an approval workflow and its status will be **Pending Approval**. It will require an approver to approve, otherwise the transactions in the payout will not be proceeded. If no approval or rejection is made within 7 days (168 hours) after the payout is made, its status will automatically become **Failed**. For more details about approval workflows, refer to [View and update approval workflows](/en/apps/workflow).</Note>

    - **Note**: Include any additional information about the transfer.
    - **Cobo Account** (or **Email** if **Recipient Confirmation on Cobo Guard** is disabled):
      - If **Recipient Confirmation on Cobo Guard** is enabled, enter the recipient's Cobo Account. Once the payout is initiated, the associated Cobo Guard will receive a message that requires the recipient to approve or reject the transaction.
      - If **Recipient Confirmation on Cobo Guard** is disabled, enter the recipient's email address, which will receive a notification upon payout receipt.
7. In the **Transaction Cost** section, select a transaction fee level, or customize the transaction fee by clicking the settings icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_advanced.svg" className="icon" alt="the settings icon" />.
8. Verify the transaction cost and click **Submit**.
9. In the **Security Verification** dialog, verify your identity with an MFA method such as Cobo Guard or Google Authenticator.

Now you have submitted a batch payout request. The request might require approval before it is processed based on the approval workflow settings.

## Next-Steps

After submitting the batch payout request, you can view the status and manage the batch or individual transaction, such as canceling, dropping, speeding up, or resending transactions. You can revoke the batch payout request before it is approved if you do not need it anymore.
