Batch Payouts is a [Cobo Portal App](/en/apps/introduction) built by Cobo that is designed to streamline the process of making multiple transfers in one go. 

This app allows you to initiate batch transfer transactions to various destination addresses with a single click, effectively addressing the need for efficient, large-scale payments. It is valuable for scenarios that require sending funds to numerous recipients simultaneously, such as payroll processing. 

Batch Payouts supports two batch transfer methods, and you can choose the one that best fits your needs:

- Complete batch transfers through multiple individual on-chain transactions.
- Complete multiple transfers in a single on-chain transaction through a Cobo-deployed smart contract.

## Key features

### Single-click transfers
You can specify various recipient addresses and assign different transfer amounts to each address. This feature enables you to initiate all transactions with just one click, significantly reducing the time and effort compared to processing each transfer individually.

### Support for smart contract batch transfers

In addition to sending multiple transfers at once, Batch Payouts also supports completing multiple transfers in a single on-chain transaction through a Cobo-deployed smart contract. This method reduces repeated signatures and lowers on-chain fees, making it more efficient for large-scale transfers.

### Support for Address Book and CSV file import
Easily add recipient addresses from your Address Book or by importing them from an uploaded CSV file. This flexibility streamlines the process of making batch payouts to multiple recipients.

### Email notifications to recipients
For each batch payout, you can specify an email address for each recipient. Once the transaction is completed, an email notification will be sent to the recipient, keeping them informed of the transaction status.

### Support for Cobo Guard Confirmation
Batch Payouts supports recipient confirmation through Cobo Guard, ensuring secure transactions. For recipients who have not created Cobo accounts or have not linked Cobo Guard, you can send a guidance email with just one click, providing them with the necessary steps.

### Batch and individual transaction management
Batch Payouts allows you to efficiently manage transactions by enabling you to speed up, drop, resend, or cancel individual transactions or entire batches as necessary.
