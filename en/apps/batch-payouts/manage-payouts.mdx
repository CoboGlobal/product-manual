This article describes how to manage batch payouts in the Batch Payouts app, including tracking payout status, revoking payouts, and other actions.

## Prerequisites

- You have [made a batch payout](/en/apps/batch-payouts/make-payout).
- You have been assigned the [Admin](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role, the [Spender](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) role, or a role with equivalent permissions.

## Steps
1. Click the Apps icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_apps.svg" className="icon" alt="the Apps icon" /> on Cobo Portal, find Batch Payouts, and then click **Open** to open the app.
2. On the overview page, you can find all the batch payouts in your organization. You can also view the total payout amount, total number of transactions, and total number of used receiving addresses.

    The status of a batch payout can be as follows:
    - Pending Approval: The payout is waiting for approvers to approve.
    - Pending Recipient Confirmation: The payout is waiting for recipient's confirmation on Cobo Guard. The transactions will be constructed after the confirmation.
    - Pending: The payout is approved and being processed.
    - Completed: The payout is completed and received by the recipients.
    - Partially Completed: Some transactions in the payout are completed while others failed
    - Revoked: The payout is revoked by the user who submitted the request.
    - Rejected: The payout is rejected by the approvers.
    - Failed: The payout failed on chain or approval timed out.

3. To perform actions on a batch payout, click the corresponding icons in the **Actions** column to perform the actions as follows:

    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_revoke.svg" className="icon" alt="the Revoke icon" /> (Revoke): Revoke a batch payout request if you do not need it anymore.

      <Note><ul><li>This action does not require any MFA approval and cannot be undone.</li><li>The batch payout must be in the Pending Approval status. Otherwise, the action will fail. You will need to cancel or drop the batch payout.</li></ul></Note> 

    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_cancel.png" className="icon" alt="the Cancel icon" /> (Cancel): Cancel a batch payout.

      <Note><ul><li>This action only applies to transactions from MPC Wallets.</li><li>All the transactions in the batch must be in either of these status: Submitted, Pending Screening, Pending Approval, or Pending Signature. Otherwise, the action will fail.</li></ul></Note>

    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_drop.png" className="icon" alt="the Drop icon" /> (Drop): Drop a batch payout.
      Dropping a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction which is a new version of the original transaction. It has a higher transaction fee to incentivize miners to prioritize its confirmation over the original one.

      <Note><ul><li>This action only applies to transactions from MPC Wallets. It does not apply to transactions on the following chains: VET, TRON, TVET, SOL, and TON.</li><li>All the transactions in the batch must be in the Broadcasting status. Otherwise, the action will fail.</li></ul></Note>

    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_speed_up.png" className="icon" alt="the Speed Up icon" /> (Speed up): Accelerate a batch payout.
      Speeding up a transaction will trigger a Replace-By-Fee (RBF) transaction which is a new version of the original transaction. It shares the same inputs but has a higher transaction fee to incentivize miners to prioritize its confirmation over the previous one.

      <Note><ul><li>This action only applies to transactions from MPC Wallets. It does not apply to transactions on the following chains: VET, TRON, TVET, SOL, and TON.</li><li>All the transactions in the batch must be in the Broadcasting status. Otherwise, the action will fail.</li></ul></Note>

    - <img src="/en/images/portal-apps/batch-payouts/icon_resend.png" className="icon" alt="the Resend icon" /> (Resend): Resend a failed batch payout.
      Resending a transaction initiates a new attempt to process the transaction that failed previously.

      <Note><ul><li>This action only applies to transactions from MPC Wallets in the SOL token.</li><li>All the transactions in the batch must be in the Failed status. Otherwise, the action will fail.</li></ul></Note>

5. To perform actions on individual transactions in a batch payout, click the **View Details** icon <img src="/en/images/common/icon_view.svg" className="icon" alt="the view icon" /> beside a batch payout to view details of individual transactions in the batch, and cancel, drop, speed up, or resend specific transactions that meet the above requirements.
