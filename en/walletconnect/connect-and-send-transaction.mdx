## Prerequisites

You must have one of the following [roles](/en/portal/organization/roles-and-permissions) to initiate and manage WalletConnect connections/disconnections:

- Admin
- Spender

## Steps

### 1. Get a pairing link from the dApp

1. Open the target dApp.
2. Choose WalletConnect as the connection method.
3. Obtain the WalletConnect pairing link.

### 2. Initiate the connection in Cobo Portal

1. Log in to Cobo Portal.
2. Go to **Wallets** -> **WalletConnect**.

3. Paste or enter the pairing link, then click **Connect**.
4. Select the wallet address you want to use.
5. Review the dApp connection details and risk information (if applicable), then confirm to establish the connection.

### 3. Send a transaction request from the dApp

1. Go back to the connected dApp.
2. Initiate an action in the dApp, such as swapping, staking, or lending.
3. The dApp will send a transaction request to Cobo through WalletConnect.

On the Cobo side, the request will enter the standard transaction workflow:

- Spender approval (callback)
- Risk control approval
- MPC signing

You can verify the dApp connection information in Cobo Portal transaction records and Cobo Guard approval messages. The following screenshot shows the **Connection information** section in Cobo Portal transaction records.

## Next steps

On the WalletConnect management page, you can view active connections initiated by you (expired or disconnected connections are not shown).

- You can manually disconnect a connection. After disconnection, the dApp can no longer send new transaction requests, but it does not affect transactions that have already been initiated and are in progress.
- Each connection is valid for 1 day by default. If you do not disconnect it within the validity period, the system will automatically close the connection. After a connection is closed, the dApp must reconnect before initiating new actions.
