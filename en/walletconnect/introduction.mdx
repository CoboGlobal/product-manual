WalletConnect is an industry-standard open protocol that connects wallets with dApps. With WalletConnect, you can securely use your wallet to interact with dApps on any device, without installing a browser extension.

In Cobo Portal, WalletConnect can be used to:

- Connect dApps using your [MPC Wallets](/en/portal/mpc-wallets/introduction) or [Web3 Wallets](/en/portal/custodial-wallets/web3-wallets/introduction).
- Complete connection and transaction operations in Cobo Portal web UI, while transactions still follow Cobo’s existing withdrawal approval, risk control, and MPC signing workflows.
- Centralize permission control, risk prompts, and connection management.

## Supported chains

- Solana
- EVM-compatible chains, such as:
  - Ethereum
  - Base
  - Arbitrum One
  - Optimism
  - BNB Smart Chain

## WalletConnect vs Cobo Connect

WalletConnect and Cobo Connect are both dApp connection solutions provided by Cobo:

- Cobo Connect connects to dApps through a browser extension.
- WalletConnect does not require an extension and lets you connect directly in Cobo Portal.

Compared with Cobo Connect, WalletConnect provides better multi-chain support and overall user experience. We recommend using WalletConnect whenever possible. Cobo Connect will be gradually phased out based on actual usage. During the transition period, both WalletConnect and Cobo Connect will be supported.
